Super Galactic is an on-chain action strategy game that combines collectible NFT characters, a multichain asset system and a sustainable in game economy powered by the UAP token. The game has completed its open beta phase and is fully audited by CertiK, giving it a high level of technical readiness before the launch of the UAP token.

The UFO Gaming brand has migrated to the [INTO.SPACE](http://INTO.SPACE) ecosystem, where the new SPACE token operates on the Solana network. Super Galactic continues forward as an independent gaming product and maintains its game economy on Ethereum with a multichain expansion to Avalanche and BNB. This architecture removes the volatility and contamination risks that traditional P2E economies faced, separating the core ecosystem token (SPACE) from the game economy token (UAP).

Genesis NFT holders have already completed the Plasma onboarding phase, which successfully distributed game ready assets and established the foundation of the Super Galactic player base. With Plasma now concluded, the system transitions into a focused UAP driven game economy that powers breeding, player progression and reward sinks.

Super Galactic enters the market at a time when Web3 gaming is growing from speculation driven models into sustainable ownership based experiences. The combination of audited infrastructure, live open beta gameplay, a proven NFT distribution model and a clear economic design positions Super Galactic to attract both players and long term investors.
