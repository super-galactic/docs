Super Galactic uses an **automated, usage-based burn mechanism** to permanently reduce UAP supply as players engage with the game.

Burns are not scheduled events tied to calendars or promotional campaigns. They are triggered directly by gameplay spending, ensuring that supply reduction scales naturally with player activity.

This design links economic growth to scarcity rather than inflation.

---

## Automatic Burn Trigger

Every time UAP is spent inside the game, the burn mechanism is triggered automatically.

- Burns occur at the point of in game spending
- No player action or claim step is required
- The process is enforced at the system level

As long as players are progressing, upgrading, or engaging with core gameplay systems, automated burns are continuously occurring.

---

## Burn and Treasury Allocation

All in game UAP spending follows a fixed allocation model:

- **50 percent of spent UAP is permanently burned**
- **50 percent is routed to the game treasury**

The burn portion is removed from circulation permanently, directly reducing circulating supply. This allocation applies consistently across all gameplay systems that consume UAP.

---

## Usage-Based Supply Reduction

Burns scale proportionally with gameplay activity.

- More gameplay leads to more spending
- More spending leads to more burns
- More burns reduce circulating supply

There are no fixed burn schedules or time based burn events. Supply reduction is driven entirely by how actively the game is played.

This ensures that growth strengthens scarcity instead of diluting it.

## Treasury-Controlled Burns

The portion of UAP routed to the game treasury provides economic flexibility without compromising automation.

While the automated burn portion is enforced at the system level, the treasury portion may be partially or fully burned at the discretion of the team if additional supply reduction is required to maintain long-term economic balance.

Key principles governing treasury-controlled burns:

- Treasury burns are optional and governance driven
- Any manual burns are executed transparently on-chain
- Burns may be used to reinforce scarcity during periods of sustained activity or post milestone phases
- Treasury burns do not replace or override the automated burn mechanism

This structure preserves a rules-based economy while allowing responsible long-term supply management.

---

## Transparency and Enforcement

Burn mechanisms in Super Galactic are:

- Rule based
- Transparent
- Consistently enforced
- Verifiable on-chain

Automated burns occur as part of gameplay transactions, while any treasury-controlled burns are clearly communicated and independently verifiable.

---

## Relationship to Token Sinks

Token sinks are the primary trigger for burn activity.

Whenever players spend UAP on:

- Progression upgrades
- Breeding or creation systems
- Optional unlocks or customization

The burn mechanism is applied as part of the same transaction flow.

Details on spending systems are covered in **Game Economy → Token Sinks**.

## Why This Matters

By enforcing burns at the point of gameplay spending:

- Supply reduction is organic and predictable
- Scarcity increases alongside engagement
- Inflationary pressure is structurally avoided
- Economic incentives remain aligned with gameplay

Unlike emission driven play to earn models, Super Galactic converts activity into controlled supply reduction rather than runaway token expansion.

---

## Design Principles

The burn mechanism is built around the following principles:

- Automated burns must be system enforced
- Supply reduction must scale with gameplay activity
- Manual intervention must be transparent and limited to treasury actions
- Players should not need to manage or trigger burns

This approach supports long-term stability while keeping the player experience simple and predictable.
