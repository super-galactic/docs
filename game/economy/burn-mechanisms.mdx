Burn mechanisms are a core component of Super Galactic’s closed-loop economy. They permanently remove UAP from circulation as a direct result of gameplay activity, ensuring that increased engagement strengthens the economy rather than diluting it.

Unlike scheduled or promotional burns, Super Galactic uses **automated, usage-based burns** that are triggered directly by in-game spending. Supply reduction therefore scales naturally with how the game is played.

### Purpose of Burn Mechanisms

Burn mechanisms serve several critical roles within the game economy:

- Permanently reduce circulating UAP in proportion to player activity
- Counterbalance reward distribution over time
- Reinforce long-term scarcity without restricting access
- Align economic outcomes with real gameplay engagement

By tying burns directly to progression and spending, the system avoids artificial scarcity and allows supply reduction to emerge organically from player behaviour.

### Automatic Burn Trigger

Every time UAP is spent inside the game, the burn mechanism is triggered automatically.

- Burns occur at the point of in game spending
- No player action or claim step is required
- The process is enforced at the system level

As long as players are progressing, upgrading, or engaging with core gameplay systems, automated burns are continuously occurring.

### Burn and Treasury Allocation

All in game UAP spending follows a fixed allocation model:

- **50 percent of spent UAP is permanently burned**
- **50 percent is routed to the game treasury**

The burn portion is removed from circulation permanently, directly reducing circulating supply. This allocation applies consistently across all gameplay systems that consume UAP.

> **Example:**\
> If a player spends 1000 UAP on an upgrade, 500 UAP is permanently burned and 500 UAP is routed to the game treasury

### Usage-Based Supply Reduction

Burns scale proportionally with gameplay activity.

- More gameplay leads to more spending
- More spending leads to more burns
- More burns reduce circulating supply

There are no fixed burn schedules or time based burn events. Supply reduction is driven entirely by how actively the game is played.

This ensures that growth strengthens scarcity instead of diluting it.

### Relationship to Token Sinks

Token sinks act as the primary **entry point** for burn execution.

- Players spend UAP through progression systems
- Spending triggers the system allocation split
- Burns reduce circulating supply
- Treasury flows support ongoing development and operations

This design tightly couples progression, spending, and supply management into a single coherent system.

Details on where and how UAP is spent are documented in **Game Economy → Token Sinks**.

### Fixed Supply Enforcement

Super Galactic operates on a **fixed total supply model**.

- No new UAP is minted through gameplay
- Burns permanently reduce circulating supply
- Supply cannot increase beyond the predefined cap

Burn mechanisms do not offset inflation, they prevent it entirely by ensuring that circulation is continuously regulated by usage.

### Treasury-Controlled Burns

The portion of UAP routed to the game treasury provides economic flexibility without compromising automation.

While the automated burn portion is enforced at the system level, the treasury portion may be partially or fully burned at the discretion of the team if additional supply reduction is required to maintain long-term economic balance.

Key principles governing treasury-controlled burns:

- Treasury burns are optional and governance driven
- Any manual burns are executed transparently on-chain
- Burns may be used to reinforce scarcity during periods of sustained activity or post milestone phases
- Treasury burns do not replace or override the automated burn mechanism

This structure preserves a rules-based economy while allowing responsible long-term supply management.

### Transparency and Verification

Burn mechanisms in Super Galactic are:

- Rule-based
- Transparent
- Consistently enforced
- Verifiable on-chain

Automated burns occur as part of gameplay transactions, while any treasury-controlled burns are clearly communicated and independently auditable.

### Economic Role of Burn Mechanisms

Burn mechanisms complete the economic loop by converting gameplay activity into controlled supply reduction.

- Rewards introduce UAP through gameplay
- Token sinks create structured demand
- Burns permanently remove supply

Together, these systems ensure that increased engagement strengthens the economy rather than destabilizing it.

### Design Principles

Burn mechanisms in Super Galactic follow these principles:

- Burns must be driven by gameplay, not speculation
- Supply reduction should emerge organically from progression
- No scheduled, manual, or marketing-driven burns
- Players should never be required to manage or trigger burns directly

This approach supports long-term stability while keeping the player experience predictable and frictionless.
