Burn mechanisms define how UAP is permanently removed from circulation as a direct result of in game economic activity. Burns are automated, usage based, and enforced at the system level.

This page defines **when burns occur**, **how they are executed**, and **how they affect circulating supply**.

### Burn Trigger

Burns are triggered by **in game UAP spending only**.

Any action that consumes UAP through gameplay systems automatically initiates burn execution. Burns are not triggered by trading, transfers, or marketplace activity.

### Execution Model

Burn execution is:

- Automatic
- Immediate at the point of spend
- Enforced by smart contract logic
- Independent of player action

Players do not claim, opt in, or manage burns. As long as UAP is spent through gameplay systems, burn execution occurs.

### Burn and Game Treasury Split

All in game UAP spending follows a fixed system level split:

- **50%** of spent UAP is permanently burned
- **50%** is routed to the Game Treasury

_Example: If 1,000 UAP is spent on a gameplay action, 500 UAP is burned and 500 UAP is routed to the Game Treasury._

This split applies uniformly across all gameplay systems that consume UAP.

### Supply Impact

Burns permanently reduce player circulating supply.

- Total supply remains fixed and capped
- Burned UAP is removed irreversibly
- Player circulating supply decreases through in game spending and burn execution

Burn volume scales with gameplay activity. As players spend more UAP through progression systems, more UAP is burned automatically.

### Game Treasury Role

A portion of spent UAP is routed to the Game Treasury as part of the system level split.

Treasury control boundaries and reintroduction rules are defined in **Economy Overview** → [Automated Burn and Treasury Routing](/game/economy/economy-overview).

Treasury routing is separate from burn execution. Burns still executes on every in game spend.

### Transparency and Verification

All burn execution and Game Treasury routing occur on chain and are auditable.

- Burned supply can be verified through token contract events
- Treasury balances and movements are publicly observable

This ensures that supply reduction is transparent and rule enforced.

### Scope and References

This page defines burn execution only.

- What consumes UAP is defined in [Token Sinks](/game/economy/token-sinks) and [Breeding Economics](/game/economy/breeding-economics)
- How rewards enter circulation is defined in [Rewards System](/game/economy/rewards-system)
- Supply allocation and trading related taxes are defined in [Tokenomics](/game/tokenomics/supply-and-allocation)

<Note>
  Burn Mechanisms close the economic loop by converting gameplay spending into permanent supply reduction under explicit system constraints.
