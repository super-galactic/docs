## Supply Reduction and Scarcity

Supply reduction is a core component of the Super Galactic game economy.

Whenever **UAP** is spent through in-game systems, a fixed portion of that spend is permanently removed from circulation. Because burns are triggered directly by gameplay actions, supply reduction occurs continuously as players upgrade, progress, and interact with the game.

**UAP does not rely on unlimited minting.** As a result, in-game spending plays a central role in managing circulating supply over time.

This system is designed to control inflation and support long-term economic balance through play rather than speculation.

## How Burning Works

All UAP spent in game follows a predefined allocation model:

- **50 percent of spent UAP is permanently burned**
- **50 percent is allocated to the reserve wallet**

Burning occurs automatically at the point of spend and applies to all gameplay systems equally.

## What Triggers a Burn

UAP burns occur through standard gameplay actions, including but not limited to:

- Character and equipment upgrades
- Breeding and creation systems
- Progression related unlocks

Any action that consumes UAP through the core game systems will trigger the burn mechanism.

## Purpose of the Burn Mechanism

The burn mechanism exists to manage circulating UAP in a predictable and system-driven way.

- Reduce circulating supply when UAP is actively spent in-game
- Align long-term gameplay progression with controlled supply dynamics
- Ensure that increased gameplay activity naturally results in higher supply reduction
- Apply consistent economic rules without requiring forced participation

Burns occur automatically through normal gameplay actions. Supply reduction is continuous and does not depend on manual intervention or scheduled events.

## Relationship to Player Activity

Burn intensity scales with engagement.

- Higher activity leads to higher total burns
- Increased progression results in increased UAP consumption
- Advanced players naturally contribute more to burn volume

This creates a feedback loop where growth in the player base and progression depth strengthens supply control rather than weakening it.

## Transparency and Verifiability

All burn events are recorded on chain.

- Burned UAP is permanently removed from circulation
- Burn transactions are publicly verifiable
- The process is transparent and auditable

This ensures players can independently verify burn activity without relying on off chain reporting.

## Design Principles

The burn mechanism in Super Galactic is built around the following principles:

- Circulating supply should be managed through gameplay activity, not time-based emissions
- Burns must be automatic and predictable
- Supply reduction should occur as a direct result of in-game activity
- Supply changes should reflect actual in-game usage
