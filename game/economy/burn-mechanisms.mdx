Super Galactic uses an **automated, usage-based burn mechanism** to permanently reduce UAP supply as players engage with the game.

Burns are not scheduled events tied to calendars or promotional campaigns. They are triggered directly by gameplay spending, ensuring that supply reduction scales naturally with player activity.

This design links economic growth to scarcity rather than inflation.

---

## Automatic Burn Trigger

Every time UAP is spent inside the game, the burn mechanism is triggered automatically.

- Burns occur at the point of in game spending
- No player action or claim step is required
- The process is enforced at the system level

As long as players are progressing, upgrading, or engaging with core gameplay systems, automated burns are continuously occurring.

---

## Burn and Treasury Allocation

All in game UAP spending follows a fixed allocation model:

- **50 percent of spent UAP is permanently burned**
- **50 percent is routed to the game treasury**

The burn portion is removed from circulation permanently, directly reducing circulating supply. This allocation applies consistently across all gameplay systems that consume UAP.

---

## Usage-Based Supply Reduction

Burns scale proportionally with gameplay activity.

- More gameplay leads to more spending
- More spending leads to more burns
- More burns reduce circulating supply

There are no fixed burn schedules or time based burn events. Supply reduction is driven entirely by how actively the game is played.

This ensures that growth strengthens scarcity instead of diluting it.

---

## Treasury-Controlled Burns

The portion of UAP routed to the game treasury provides economic flexibility without compromising automation.

While the automated burn portion is enforced at the system level, the treasury portion may be partially or fully burned at the discretion of the team if additional supply reduction is required to maintain long-term economic balance.

Key principles governing treasury-controlled burns:

- Treasury burns are optional and governance driven
- Any manual burns are executed transparently on-chain
- Burns may be used to reinforce scarcity during periods of sustained activity or post milestone phases
- Treasury burns do not replace or override the automated burn mechanism

This structure preserves a rules-based economy while allowing responsible long-term supply management.

---

## Transparency and Enforcement

Burn mechanisms in Super Galactic are:

- Rule based
- Transparent
- Consistently enforced
- Verifiable on-chain

Automated burns occur as part of gameplay transactions, while any treasury-controlled burns are clearly communicated and independently verifiable.

---

## Relationship to Token Sinks

Token sinks are the primary trigger for burn activity.

Whenever players spend UAP on:

- Progression upgrades
- Breeding or creation systems
- Optional unlocks or customization

The burn mechanism is applied as part of the same transaction flow.

Details on spending systems are covered in **Game Economy → Token Sinks**.

---

## Why This Matters

By enforcing burns at the point of gameplay spending:

- Supply reduction is organic and predictable
- Scarcity increases alongside engagement
- Inflationary pressure is structurally avoided
- Economic incentives remain aligned with gameplay

Unlike emission driven play to earn models, Super Galactic converts activity into controlled supply reduction rather than runaway token expansion.

---

## Design Principles

The burn mechanism is built around the following principles:

- Automated burns must be system enforced
- Supply reduction must scale with gameplay activity
- Manual intervention must be transparent and limited to treasury actions
- Players should not need to manage or trigger burns

This approach supports long-term stability while keeping the player experience simple and predictable.

### Supply Reduction and Scarcity

Supply reduction is a core component of the Super Galactic game economy.

Whenever **UAP** is spent through in-game systems, a fixed portion of that spend is permanently removed from circulation. Because burns are triggered directly by gameplay actions, supply reduction occurs continuously as players upgrade, progress, and interact with the game.

**UAP does not rely on unlimited minting.** As a result, in-game spending plays a central role in managing circulating supply over time.

This system is designed to control inflation and support long-term economic balance through play rather than speculation.

## How Burning Works

All UAP spent in game follows a predefined allocation model:

- **50 percent of spent UAP is permanently burned**
- **50 percent is allocated to the reserve wallet**

Burning occurs automatically at the point of spend and applies to all gameplay systems equally.

## What Triggers a Burn

UAP burns occur through standard gameplay actions, including but not limited to:

- Character and equipment upgrades
- Breeding and creation systems
- Progression related unlocks

Any action that consumes UAP through the core game systems will trigger the burn mechanism.

## Purpose of the Burn Mechanism

The burn mechanism exists to manage circulating UAP in a predictable and system-driven way.

- Reduce circulating supply when UAP is actively spent in-game
- Align long-term gameplay progression with controlled supply dynamics
- Ensure that increased gameplay activity naturally results in higher supply reduction
- Apply consistent economic rules without requiring forced participation

Burns occur automatically through normal gameplay actions. Supply reduction is continuous and does not depend on manual intervention or scheduled events.

## Relationship to Player Activity

Burn intensity scales with engagement.

- Higher activity leads to higher total burns
- Increased progression results in increased UAP consumption
- Advanced players naturally contribute more to burn volume

This creates a feedback loop where growth in the player base and progression depth strengthens supply control rather than weakening it.

## Transparency and Verifiability

All burn events are recorded on chain.

- Burned UAP is permanently removed from circulation
- Burn transactions are publicly verifiable
- The process is transparent and auditable

This ensures players can independently verify burn activity without relying on off chain reporting.

## Design Principles

The burn mechanism in Super Galactic is built around the following principles:

- Circulating supply should be managed through gameplay activity, not time-based emissions
- Burns must be automatic and predictable
- Supply reduction should occur as a direct result of in-game activity
- Supply changes should reflect actual in-game usage
