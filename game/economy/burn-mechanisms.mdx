Burn mechanisms are a core component of Super Galactic’s closed-loop economy. They permanently remove UAP from circulation as a direct result of gameplay activity, ensuring that increased engagement strengthens the economy rather than diluting it.

Unlike scheduled or promotional burns, Super Galactic uses **automated, usage-based burns** that are triggered directly by in-game spending. Supply reduction therefore scales naturally with how the game is played.

### Purpose of Burn Mechanisms

Burn mechanisms serve several roles within the game economy. They reduce circulating UAP in proportion to player activity, counterbalance reward distribution over time, and align economic outcomes with real gameplay engagement. By tying burns directly to progression and spending, the system avoids artificial scarcity and allows supply reduction to emerge organically from player behaviour.

### Automatic Burn Trigger

Every time UAP is spent inside the game, the burn mechanism is triggered automatically. Burns occur at the point of in-game spending, require no claim step, and are enforced at the system level. As long as players are progressing, upgrading, or engaging with core gameplay systems, automated burns occur continuously.

### Burn and Treasury Split

All in-game UAP spending follows a fixed split:

- **50% of spent UAP is permanently burned**
- **50% is routed to the Game Treasury**

The burn portion is removed from circulation permanently, directly reducing circulating supply. This split applies consistently across gameplay systems that consume UAP.

> Example: If a player spends 1,000 UAP on an upgrade, 500 UAP is permanently burned and 500 UAP is routed to the Game Treasury.

### Game Treasury

The Game Treasury is a system wallet used to support long-term economic health and reward continuity. Funds routed to the Game Treasury may be reintroduced into the Play to Earn reward pool or burned, based on internal economic balancing decisions.

### Usage-Based Supply Reduction

Burns scale proportionally with gameplay activity. More gameplay leads to more spending, more spending leads to more burns, and more burns reduce circulating supply. There are no fixed burn schedules or time-based burn events, since supply reduction is driven by how actively the game is played.

### Fixed Supply Enforcement

Super Galactic operates on a fixed total supply model. No new UAP is minted through gameplay, and burns permanently reduce circulating supply while keeping total supply capped.

### Treasury-Controlled Burns

The portion of UAP routed to the Game Treasury provides economic flexibility without compromising automation. While the automated burn portion is enforced at the system level, the treasury portion may be partially or fully burned based on internal economic balancing decisions if additional supply reduction is required to maintain long-term economic balance.

Treasury actions do not replace or override the automated burn mechanism. They are an additional tool for long-term management within the same fixed-supply framework.

### Transparency and Verification

Automated burns occur as part of gameplay transactions and are enforceable and auditable. Any treasury-controlled burns or reintroductions are communicated clearly and can be verified on-chain.

### Design Principles

Burn mechanisms in Super Galactic follow these principles: burns must be driven by gameplay, supply reduction should emerge from progression, there are no scheduled or promotional burns as a substitute for system design, and players are never required to manage or trigger burns directly.

This approach supports long-term stability while keeping the player experience predictable and frictionless.
