Breeding in Super Galactic is a **high commitment progression system** that allows players to create or enhance playable assets by spending UAP.

Unlike reward distribution systems, breeding is intentionally designed as a **consumptive economic action**. It represents a deliberate decision to reinvest earned value back into the ecosystem in exchange for long-term gameplay benefits.

As a result, breeding functions as one of the most impactful token sinks within the game economy.

## Purpose of Breeding as an Economic System

Breeding serves multiple roles within the closed-loop economy:

- Introduces meaningful UAP consumption tied to asset creation
- Supports long-term engagement through progression and diversity
- Reinforces scarcity by linking advancement to permanent spend
- Prevents passive accumulation without reinvestment

Breeding is not designed for rapid repetition. It is designed for intentional participation.

## UAP Consumption at Execution

All breeding actions require UAP and consume it **at the point of execution**.

Key characteristics:

- UAP is spent immediately when a breeding action is initiated
- There are no deferred costs or delayed deductions
- Spending is enforced at the system level

This ensures that breeding directly contributes to supply reduction and treasury flows without loopholes or timing exploits.

---

## Scaling Costs and Commitment

Breeding costs are designed to scale with progression rather than time.

- Early breeding actions require lower UAP commitment
- Advanced breeding introduces higher cost decisions
- Cost scaling reflects asset value and progression depth

As players advance, breeding naturally becomes a higher impact economic choice rather than a routine action.

## Economic Impact and Balance

Because breeding consumes UAP and produces long-term gameplay value, it plays a critical role in balancing reward issuance over time.

- Rewards introduce UAP into circulation
- Breeding removes UAP from circulation pathways
- Progression remains sustainable as activity increases

This ensures that asset creation does not undermine economic stability.

---

## Relationship to Burn Mechanisms

All UAP spent through breeding follows the same allocation logic as other token sinks:

- A portion of spent UAP is permanently burned
- The remaining portion is routed to the game treasury

Breeding therefore acts as a direct trigger for automated burn activity, linking asset growth to supply reduction.

Detailed allocation logic is covered in **Game Economy → ** [**Burn Mechanisms**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/burn-mechanisms).

## Anti-Abuse Design

Breeding is protected by several structural safeguards:

- No passive or idle breeding mechanics
- Costs scale with progression to discourage spam
- Breeding requires deliberate player intent

These safeguards ensure that breeding remains a meaningful economic decision rather than a farming exploit.

> Breeding is governed by structural limits and participation caps designed to prevent unlimited asset creation.
