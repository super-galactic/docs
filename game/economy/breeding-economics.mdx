Breeding is a high commitment economic system that converts UAP into controlled roster expansion. It increases long term progression demand while keeping character supply bounded by explicit constraints.

Breeding does not exist to accelerate reward extraction. It exists to expand gameplay capacity and reinvestment depth within the fixed supply economy.

### Economic Role of Breeding

Breeding serves three system level economic functions:

1. **Token demand creation**\
   Breeding requires UAP at the point of execution, creating direct and deliberate demand tied to player intent.
2. **Controlled asset expansion**\
   New playable characters are created only through predefined generational rules and capped attempts, preventing uncontrolled supply growth.
3. **Reinvestment amplification**\
   Each new character re enters the progression loop, creating additional long term demand through upgrades and development.

Breeding is therefore a conversion system, not a reward system.

### Breeding as a High Commitment Sink

Breeding represents one of the highest impact UAP sinks in the economy.

- UAP is consumed immediately at execution
- Costs increase with repeated attempts
- Outcomes increase future progression requirements

Unlike upgrades, which refine existing assets, breeding creates new progression surfaces that require sustained reinvestment over time.

Breeding execution consumes UAP and follows the burn and Game Treasury routing defined in [Burn Mechanisms](/game/economy/burn-mechanisms).

### Progression Capacity Expansion

Breeding expands gameplay capacity by increasing the number of playable characters available to a player.

This expansion has two economic effects:

- It increases the number of progression paths a player can maintain concurrently
- It increases long term upgrade and optimisation demand across the roster

Breeding does not bypass reward constraints. It increases the number of assets participating in the same constrained reward system.

Reward extraction limits remain governed by the rules defined in [Rewards System.](/game/economy/rewards-system)

### Player Economic Participation Paths

Breeding supports multiple valid economic behaviors without privileging any single strategy.

**Roster Expansion**\
Players may breed to expand their playable roster, increasing long term progression depth and reinvestment demand.

**Breeder to Market**\
Players may breed and transfer offspring through the marketplace, enabling secondary distribution of playable assets without expanding Genesis supply.

**Collector and Hybrid Participation**\
Some players breed for identity, rarity, or hybrid composition rather than optimisation efficiency. These paths still generate UAP demand through creation and subsequent progression.

All paths result in UAP consumption and increased long term sink pressure.

### Cost Scaling and Supply Control

Breeding costs are intentionally scaled to enforce commitment and prevent excessive expansion.

- Early breeding attempts are more accessible
- Repeated attempts require increasing UAP commitment
- Attempt caps and generational rules limit total output

These controls ensure that asset expansion remains proportional to player engagement and economic participation rather than time or automation.

Detailed breeding limits and inheritance rules are documented in [Breeding System](/game/nfts-assets/breeding-system).

### Relationship to the Closed Loop Economy

Breeding reinforces the closed loop economy by converting earned UAP into durable gameplay capacity.

- Rewards introduce UAP into circulation through gameplay
- Breeding consumes UAP to create new progression surfaces
- New assets drive additional upgrade and progression demand
- Spending triggers automated burn execution

This loop ties ecosystem growth directly to player commitment and reinvestment rather than inflationary distribution.
