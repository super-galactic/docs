## The Gameplay Flywheel

**Super Galactic Flywheel**  
Activity → Spend → Burn → Scarcity → Stronger Incentives  
Growth strengthens the economy instead of diluting it.

1. Players complete missions → earn UAP  
2. Players upgrade Genesis characters and weapons → spend UAP  
3. Spending triggers automatic burns → circulating supply decreases  
4. Scarcity increases → progression becomes more valuable  
5. Stronger incentives attract more active players  
6. Activity increases → the cycle accelerates
