Super Galactic operates on a **closed-loop, gameplay-driven economy** powered by the UAP token.

The economy is designed around **fixed supply, controlled distribution, and automated supply reduction**. Tokens only move into or out of circulation as a direct result of real gameplay activity. There are no emissions tied to time, speculation, or passive participation.

This structure supports a system where increased engagement reinforces economic balance rather than destabilizing it.

### Fixed Supply and Circulation Control

UAP has a **fixed, capped total supply** with no ongoing minting.

Gameplay does not mint new tokens. Instead, existing UAP moves between players, the game, and permanent removal through burn mechanisms. Player activity influences **circulating supply**, not total supply, based on how UAP is earned, spent, and consumed.

This approach deliberately avoids inflationary dynamics common in earlier Web3 game economies.

For full supply details and allocation, see [**Supply & Allocation**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/tokenomics/supply-and-allocation).

### Gameplay-Driven Token Entry

UAP enters player hands exclusively through **active gameplay**.

Players earn UAP by completing PvE missions and engaging with core game systems. There are no idle rewards, login bonuses, or yield mechanics disconnected from play.

Reward logic, eligibility, and earning limits are documented in [**Rewards System**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/rewards-system).

### Progression as Sustained Token Demand

Progression systems are the primary source of long-term UAP demand.

Players spend UAP to upgrade Genesis characters and weapons, unlocking deeper progression and improved gameplay performance. These systems are designed to scale with rarity and advancement depth, increasing UAP demand as players progress further.

All progression spending permanently consumes UAP from the player’s balance, then routes it through the burn and Game Treasury flow described below.

Detailed progression sinks are covered in [**Token Sinks**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/token-sinks).

### Automated Burn and Treasury Flow

Every time UAP is spent in-game, a **system-level allocation** is triggered automatically:

- A fixed portion of UAP is permanently burned
- The remaining fixed portion is routed to the Game Treasury

> For the exact split, see Game Economy → Burn Mechanisms → **Burn and Treasury Split**

This process is usage-based, transparent, and enforced by the system. As player activity increases, total burn volume increases proportionally without relying on scheduled events or manual intervention.

Complete burn logic and the exact split are documented in Burn Mechanisms [**Burn Mechanisms**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/burn-mechanisms).

### The Gameplay Flywheel

Super Galactic’s economy functions as a self-reinforcing loop:

1. Players complete missions and earn UAP
2. Players spend UAP on progression systems
3. Spending triggers automated burns and treasury allocation
4. Circulating supply is reduced through burns
5. Progression value increases, reinforcing engagement
6. Increased activity strengthens the overall system

This flywheel ensures that growth is tied to participation and progression rather than uncontrolled supply expansion.

### Design Intent

The economy is intentionally structured to avoid common failure modes:

- No unlimited minting
- No passive yield loops
- No rewards without sinks
- No reliance on speculative behavior

Instead, it is driven by:

- Skill-based gameplay
- Long-term progression commitment
- Automated supply reduction
- Transparent, rule-based systems

The result is an economy designed to be **playable, sustainable, and economically sound**.
