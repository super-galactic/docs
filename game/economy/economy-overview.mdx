Super Galactic operates on a closed loop, gameplay driven economy powered by the UAP token.

UAP only enters player circulation as a result of active gameplay. There are no emissions tied to time, speculation, or passive participation. Economic activity is bounded by fixed supply, explicit sinks, and automated burn enforcement.

### Fixed Supply Model

UAP has a fixed, capped total supply. Gameplay does not mint new tokens.

All UAP distributed through gameplay already exists within the total supply. Player activity determines how much of that supply becomes circulating, not how much supply exists. This ensures long term predictability and prevents inflation through participation.

### Gameplay Driven Entry

UAP enters player hands exclusively through eligible PvE gameplay. Rewards are generated from mission completion and performance outcomes. There are no idle rewards, login bonuses, or yield mechanics detached from gameplay.

Reward eligibility, limits, and claim behavior are defined in [Rewards System](/game/economy/rewards-system).

### Progression as Primary Demand

Progression systems are the primary source of sustained UAP demand.

Players spend UAP to upgrade characters, weapons, and other progression systems. Spending scales with advancement depth, rarity, and long term commitment. As players progress further, UAP demand increases naturally through gameplay driven decisions rather than forced sinks.

Detailed progression sinks are documented in [Token Sinks](/game/economy/token-sinks) and [Breeding Economics](/game/economy/breeding-economics).

### Automated Burn and Treasury Routing

All in game UAP spending triggers an automated system level split.

A fixed portion of spent UAP is permanently burned. The remaining portion is routed to the Game Treasury. Burn execution is enforced at the system level and does not require player action.

Burn logic and treasury behavior are defined in [Burn Mechanisms](/game/economy/burn-mechanisms).

### Circulating Supply Dynamics

Circulating supply is dynamic.

It increases when players earn and claim UAP through gameplay. It decreases when players spend UAP on progression systems and burns are executed. As gameplay activity increases, both reward distribution and burn volume increase proportionally.

Total supply remains fixed at all times.

### Closed Loop Flow (Player Circulation)

The economy follows a repeatable causal loop:

- Gameplay produces reward outcomes
- Rewards introduce existing UAP into circulation
- Progression spending consumes UAP
- Spending triggers automated burns
- Burned supply reduces circulation
- Reduced circulating supply increases UAP scarcity

Treasury routing is a supply control mechanism and operates outside player circulation.

This loop ties economic outcomes directly to how the game is played rather than to external incentives.

### Economic Constraints

The economy is explicitly constrained to avoid common failure modes:

- No unlimited minting
- No passive yield systems
- No rewards without sinks
- No discretionary supply expansion

Economic pressure scales with participation, and supply reduction emerges from usage rather than scheduling.

This overview defines the economic structure only.

Detailed reward rules are covered in [Rewards System](/game/economy/rewards-system).\
Progression sinks and upgrade costs are covered in [Token Sinks](/game/economy/token-sinks) and [Breeding Economics](/game/economy/breeding-economics).\
Burn execution and treasury routing are covered in [Burn Mechanisms](/game/economy/burn-mechanisms).\
Supply allocation and market behavior are covered in [Tokenomics](/game/tokenomics/supply-and-allocation).

This structure ensures the economy remains playable, auditable, and sustainable over long term operation.
