Super Galactic operates on a closed-loop, gameplay-driven economy powered by the UAP token.

Tokens only move into or out of circulation as a direct result of gameplay activity. There are no emissions tied to time, speculation, or passive participation. This structure is designed so increased engagement reinforces economic balance rather than diluting it.

### Fixed Supply and Circulation Control

UAP has a fixed, capped total supply with no ongoing minting.

Gameplay does not mint new tokens. Instead, existing UAP moves between players and the game, with a portion permanently removed through burn mechanisms. Player activity influences circulating supply, not total supply, based on how UAP is earned and spent.

For full supply details and allocation, see [**Supply & Allocation**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/tokenomics/supply-and-allocation).

### Gameplay-Driven Token Entry

UAP enters player hands exclusively through active gameplay. Players earn UAP by completing PvE missions and engaging with core game systems. There are no idle rewards, login bonuses, or yield mechanics disconnected from play.

Reward logic, eligibility, and earning limits are documented in [**Rewards System**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/rewards-system).

### Progression as Sustained Token Demand

Progression systems are the primary source of long-term UAP demand. Players spend UAP to upgrade Genesis characters and weapons, unlocking deeper progression and improved gameplay performance. These systems are designed to scale with rarity and advancement depth, increasing UAP demand as players progress further.

All progression spending permanently consumes UAP from the player’s balance, then routes it through the burn and Game Treasury flow described below. 

Detailed progression sinks are covered in [**Token Sinks**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/token-sinks).

### Automated Burn and Game Treasury Flow

Every time UAP is spent in-game, a fixed system-level split is triggered automatically. A portion is permanently burned, and the remaining portion is routed to the Game Treasury. This process is usage-based, transparent, and enforced by the system. As player activity increases, total burn volume increases proportionally without relying on scheduled events or manual intervention.

For the exact split, see Burn Mechanisms → [**Burn and Treasury Split**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/burn-mechanisms#burn-and-treasury-split)

This process is usage-based, transparent, and enforced by the system. As player activity increases, total burn volume increases proportionally without relying on scheduled events or manual intervention. Complete burn logic and the exact split are documented in [**Burn Mechanisms**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/burn-mechanisms).

### The Gameplay Flywheel

Super Galactic’s economy functions as a self-reinforcing loop:

1. Missions earn UAP through gameplay
2. Players spend UAP on upgrades and progression
3. Spending triggers automated burns through usage
4. Burned supply reinforces scarcity
5. Scarcity increases the value of progression and rewards
6. Increased rewards and progression incentives drive more engagement and players

This flywheel ties growth to participation and progression, rather than uncontrolled supply expansion.

### Design Intent

The economy is intentionally structured to avoid common failure modes:

- No unlimited minting
- No passive yield loops
- No rewards without sinks
- No reliance on speculative behaviour

Instead, it is driven by skill-based gameplay, long-term progression commitment, and rule-based supply reduction.

The result is an economy designed to be **playable, sustainable, and economically sound**.
