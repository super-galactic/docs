Super Galactic operates on a **closed-loop, gameplay-driven economy** powered by the **UAP token**.\
Unlike traditional play-to-earn models that rely on unlimited minting, Super Galactic is built around **scarcity, automated supply reduction, and usage-based rewards**.

Every UAP token entering or leaving circulation is tied to **real player activity**: completing missions, upgrading assets, and progressing through the game. This creates a self-regulating system where growth strengthens the economy instead of destabilizing it.

## Capped Supply, No Ongoing Minting

UAP has a **fixed, capped total supply**.\
There is **no infinite emission** and no continuous minting tied to rewards.

All UAP used within the Super Galactic ecosystem already exists within the capped supply. Gameplay does not inflate the token; instead, **circulating supply dynamically adjusts** based on how players earn, spend, and upgrade.

This design directly avoids the inflationary pitfalls seen in earlier Web3 games.

## Allocation Across Chains

To support scalability and low-cost gameplay:

- **50% of the total UAP supply** is allocated for gameplay usage across **BNB Chain and Avalanche**
- **50% remains on Ethereum**, supporting liquidity, trading, and long-term ecosystem participation

Cross-chain deployment does **not** increase total supply. It only determines where UAP is used, earned, and spent.

## Mission Rewards: Earned Through Skill and Activity

Players earn UAP by completing missions with selectable difficulty levels.

- Higher difficulty = higher potential rewards
- Partial completion still yields proportional rewards
- No idle or passive earning mechanics

Reward output is **activity-bound**, ensuring UAP enters circulation only through meaningful gameplay.

## Genesis Upgrades: Core Long-Term Token Sink

Super Galactic launches with **10,000 Genesis Origin NFTs**.

Each Genesis:

- Has **6 upgradeable body parts**
- Each part can be upgraded across multiple levels
- Upgrade costs scale by **rarity and progression depth**

Upgrades permanently consume UAP.\
Every upgrade triggers the **automatic burn + treasury split**, directly reducing circulating supply.

If all Genesis assets are progressively upgraded over time, this creates **substantial, predictable token demand** driven entirely by gameplay.

## Weapons Upgrades: Parallel Progression Sink

In addition to Genesis characters, there are **10,000 weapons**, each following the same rarity distribution as Genesis assets.

Weapons:

- Are upgraded independently
- Consume UAP at scaling costs
- Follow the same automated burn mechanics

This introduces a second major progression sink, ensuring that as players advance, **UAP consumption accelerates naturally**.

## Automated Burn and Treasury Mechanism

Every time UAP is spent in-game:

- **50% is permanently burned**
- **50% is sent to the Treasury**

This process is:

- Automatic
- Usage-based
- Enforced at the system level
- Fully transparent on-chain

As player activity increases, total burns increase proportionally , without relying on manual intervention or scheduled events.

## The Gameplay Flywheel

Super Galactic’s economy is designed as a **self-reinforcing loop**:

1. Players complete missions → earn UAP
2. Players upgrade Genesis characters and weapons → spend UAP
3. Spending triggers automatic burns → circulating supply decreases
4. Scarcity increases → progression becomes more valuable
5. Stronger incentives attract more active players
6. Activity increases → the cycle accelerates

This flywheel ensures that **growth strengthens the economy** instead of diluting it.

Unlike inflationary P2E systems, increased engagement in Super Galactic results in **higher demand and stronger supply control**, not runaway emissions.

## Why This Model Works

Super Galactic avoids the structural failures seen in earlier Web3 games by ensuring:

- No unlimited minting
- No passive yield farming
- No reward loops without sinks
- No reliance on speculation alone

Instead, the economy is driven by:

- Skill-based gameplay
- Long-term progression
- Automated supply reduction
- Transparent treasury management

This creates an economy that is **playable, sustainable, and investable**.
