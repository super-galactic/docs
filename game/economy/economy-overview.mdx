Super Galactic operates on a **closed-loop, gameplay-driven economy** powered by the UAP token.

Unlike traditional play-to-earn models that rely on continuous emissions, Super Galactic is designed around **fixed supply, controlled distribution, and automatic supply reduction**. Every token entering or leaving circulation is tied directly to real player activity inside the game.

This creates a self-regulating system where increased engagement strengthens the economy instead of destabilizing it.

## Fixed Supply, No Ongoing Minting

UAP has a **fixed, capped total supply** with no ongoing minting.

Gameplay does not create new tokens. Instead, UAP already exists within the capped supply and moves between players, the game, and permanent removal through burns. As a result, player activity does not inflate supply. It dynamically adjusts circulating supply based on how UAP is earned, spent, and consumed.

This design deliberately avoids the inflationary failures seen in earlier Web3 games.

## Gameplay-Driven Token Flow

UAP enters circulation exclusively through **active gameplay**.

Players earn UAP by completing missions and engaging with game systems. There are no idle rewards, passive yield mechanics, or emissions disconnected from gameplay.

Reward logic, difficulty scaling, and earning rules are covered in [**Rewards System**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/rewards-system).

## Long-Term Progression as Token Demand

Progression in Super Galactic is designed to create **sustained, predictable token demand** over time.

Players spend UAP to upgrade Genesis characters and weapons, unlocking deeper progression and stronger gameplay performance. These upgrades permanently consume UAP and are structured to scale with rarity and progression depth.

Detailed progression sinks are documented in [**Token Sinks**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/token-sinks).

---

## Automated Burn and Treasury Flow

Every time UAP is spent inside the game, it triggers an **automatic system-level split**:

- A portion of UAP is permanently burned
- A portion is routed to the game treasury

This process is usage-based, transparent, and enforced at the protocol level. As player activity increases, total burns increase proportionally without requiring manual intervention or scheduled events.

Full burn logic is detailed in [**Burn Mechanisms**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/burn-mechanisms).

## The Gameplay Flywheel

Super Galactic’s economy operates as a **self-reinforcing loop**:

1. Players complete missions and earn UAP
2. Players spend UAP to upgrade characters and weapons
3. Spending triggers automatic burns, reducing circulating supply
4. Scarcity increases, making progression more valuable
5. Stronger incentives attract more active players
6. Increased activity accelerates the cycle

This flywheel ensures that growth strengthens the economy instead of diluting it.

## Why This Model Works

Super Galactic avoids the structural failures of earlier Web3 games by enforcing:

- No unlimited minting
- No passive yield farming
- No reward loops without sinks
- No reliance on speculation alone

Instead, the economy is driven by:

- Skill-based gameplay
- Long-term progression
- Automated supply reduction
- Transparent, rule-based systems

The result is an economy that is **playable, sustainable, and investable**.
