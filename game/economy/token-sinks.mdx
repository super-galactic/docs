Token sinks are core gameplay systems that require players to spend UAP in order to progress, customise, and optimise their experience in Super Galactic. These systems scale naturally with player advancement. As players earn more, progress further, and engage more deeply with the game, UAP consumption increases proportionally, ensuring that increased activity is matched by corresponding token demand.

> Token sinks form the primary counterbalance to reward distribution within the closed-loop economy.

### Purpose of Token Sinks

Token sinks serve several critical roles within the game economy:

- Support long-term progression systems
- Regulate circulating UAP as player activity increases
- Reinforce meaningful decision-making around upgrades and growth
- Align reward distribution with sustained gameplay engagement

By tying UAP spending directly to gameplay value, token sinks ensure that rewards earned through missions flow back into the core progression loop.

### Core Progression-Based Sinks

UAP is consumed through several key gameplay systems tied to progression and advancement. These sinks are integrated mechanics that unlock deeper gameplay, stronger performance, and expanded customisation.

### Upgrades and Enhancements

Players spend UAP to upgrade Genesis characters and weapons, improving performance-related attributes and progression depth. Upgrade costs scale as players advance, increasing UAP demand alongside progression rather than front-loading consumption.

For detailed upgrade mechanics and cost scaling, reference the [Upgrades & Progression](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/nfts-assets/upgrades-and-progression) page.

### Breeding and Creation Systems

Certain systems require UAP to create or enhance playable assets. UAP is consumed at the point of execution, costs are configurable to maintain balance and accessibility, and breeding represents a deliberate, high-impact spend. These systems act as deeper commitment sinks that support long-term engagement and asset diversity without encouraging excessive repetition.

Detailed breeding mechanics are documented separately under NFTs & Assets → Breeding System. Breeding’s economic purpose and reinvestment loops are documented under Game Economy → [Breeding Economics](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/breeding-economics).

### Future Progression and Content Expansion Sinks

Super Galactic is designed to support long-term content expansion without disrupting economic balance. Additional token sinks may be introduced over time through new progression systems and gameplay content, including:

- New Genesis characters added to the playable roster
- New weapons and combat equipment
- Additional gameplay systems such as drones or auxiliary units

These systems are introduced deliberately and require UAP at the point of unlock or creation. Each new sink is designed to integrate into existing progression loops rather than introduce standalone or repetitive spending mechanics.

### Scaling and Balance

Token sinks are designed to scale with progression rather than time. Early progression requires lower UAP spend, while advanced progression introduces higher-cost decisions. Sink intensity increases alongside reward potential, ensuring demand rises as players move into deeper progression.

Token sink costs and parameters may be adjusted over time to maintain balance and long-term sustainability. Any material changes are communicated transparently through official development updates.

### Relationship to Burn Mechanisms

All UAP spent through token sinks triggers the burn and Game Treasury split defined in Burn Mechanisms. Token sinks are therefore the primary entry point for automated burn execution and Game Treasury routing, directly linking gameplay progression to supply management. Detailed burn logic is covered in [Burn Mechanisms](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/burn-mechanisms).

### Design Principles

Token sinks in Super Galactic are guided by the following principles:

- Spending should feel purposeful, not punitive
- Progression should require commitment, not forced repetition
- Higher rewards should naturally lead to higher spend
- Sinks must scale without forcing participation

This approach ensures that UAP spending remains intuitive, fair, and aligned with long-term gameplay health.
