## Overview

Token sinks are core gameplay systems that require players to spend **UAP** in order to progress, customize, and optimize their experience in Super Galactic.

These sinks are designed to scale naturally with player advancement, ensuring that increased activity and progression are matched by corresponding UAP consumption. This helps maintain economic balance and prevents excessive accumulation over time.

## Purpose of Token Sinks

Token sinks serve multiple roles within the game economy:

- Support long-term progression systems
- Regulate UAP circulation as player activity increases
- Reinforce meaningful decision-making around upgrades and growth
- Align reward issuance with sustained gameplay engagement

By tying UAP spending directly to gameplay value, token sinks ensure that rewards earned through missions feed back into the core game loop.

## Primary Token Sink Categories

UAP is consumed through several key in-game systems.

### Upgrades and Enhancements

Players spend UAP to improve characters, equipment, and performance-related attributes.

- Stat upgrades and power scaling
- Equipment enhancement and optimization
- Progression unlocks tied to gameplay depth

Upgrade costs are designed to scale as players advance, increasing UAP demand alongside progression.

### Breeding and Creation Systems

Breeding systems require UAP to create new playable assets or enhance existing ones.

- Breeding actions consume UAP at the point of execution
- Costs are configurable to maintain fair access
- Breeding represents a deliberate and meaningful spend

Breeding acts as a high-impact sink that supports long-term engagement and asset diversity.

### Gameplay Unlocks and Customization

Additional sinks may include access to optional gameplay features or customization paths.

- Unlocking new gameplay options
- Cosmetic or progression-related customization
- Optional enhancements tied to player choice

These sinks allow players to personalize their experience while contributing to overall UAP circulation control.

## Scaling and Balance

Token sinks are intentionally designed to scale with progression rather than time.

- Early progression requires lower UAP spend
- Advanced progression introduces higher-cost decisions
- Sink intensity increases alongside reward potential

This ensures that experienced players naturally contribute more to UAP consumption as they progress deeper into the game.

## Relationship to Burn and Reserve Mechanics

All UAP spent through token sinks follows the allocation model described in the Game Economy:

- A fixed portion of spent UAP is permanently burned
- The remaining portion is allocated to the reserve wallet

Token sinks therefore serve as the primary entry point for burn and reserve flows, directly linking gameplay activity to supply management.

Detailed burn mechanics are covered in the **Burn Mechanisms** section.

## Design Principles

Token sinks in Super Galactic are built around the following principles:

- Spending should feel purposeful, not punitive
- Progression should require commitment, not grind
- Higher rewards should naturally lead to higher spend
- Sinks must scale without forcing participation

This approach ensures that UAP spending remains intuitive, fair, and aligned with long-term gameplay health.
