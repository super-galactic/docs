Token sinks are gameplay systems that consume UAP in exchange for progression, creation, or access to advanced gameplay systems. They are the primary mechanism that removes UAP from player circulation through active participation.

Token sinks scale with progression. As players advance, UAP consumption increases naturally through gameplay driven decisions rather than forced spending.

### Purpose of Token Sinks

Token sinks serve three system level functions:

- Create sustained demand for UAP
- Regulate circulating supply as reward extraction increases
- Tie economic pressure directly to gameplay progression

Spending is optional but required for advancement.

### Core Progression Sinks

UAP is consumed through progression systems that directly improve gameplay performance and long term build depth.

**Primary sinks include:**

- Genesis character upgrades
- Weapon upgrades
- Breeding execution

Each sink consumes UAP at the point of execution and immediately triggers the burn and Game Treasury routing defined in [Burn Mechanisms](/game/economy/burn-mechanisms).

### Upgrade Based Sinks

Upgrades are the most common and repeatable token sink.

- Applies to Genesis body parts and weapon NFTs
- Improves stats, rating, and performance consistency
- Costs scale by rarity and upgrade level

Upgrades do not increase reward caps. They improve the ability to perform at higher difficulty tiers reliably.

### Breeding as a High Commitment Sink

Breeding is a high impact sink that converts UAP into new playable assets.

- Requires UAP only
- Costs increase per attempt
- Produces Alpha or Beta offspring only

Breeding increases long term progression demand by expanding the playable roster, which increases future upgrade and progression spending.

Detailed breeding rules are documented in [Breeding System](/game/nfts-assets/breeding-system).\
Economic behavior is documented in [Breeding Economics](/game/economy/breeding-economics).

### Future Sink Expansion

Additional token sinks may be introduced through new gameplay systems and content expansions.

Examples include:

- New playable Genesis classes
- New weapon categories
- Auxiliary gameplay systems

New sinks will be introduced deliberately and integrated into existing progression loops. Standalone or extractive sinks will not be introduced.

### Scaling Behavior

Token sinks scale with progression depth, not time.

- Early progression requires lower UAP spend
- Advanced optimisation requires higher UAP commitment
- Demand increases alongside reward capacity

This ensures long term balance as the player base matures.

### System Constraints

Token sinks operate under the following constraints:

- Spending must provide gameplay value
- Sinks must scale with progression
- No forced or idle spending loops
- All spending is explicit and user approved

Token sinks close the loop between rewards and supply reduction, ensuring that economic pressure grows in proportion to gameplay engagement.
