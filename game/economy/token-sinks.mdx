Token sinks are core gameplay systems that require players to spend UAP in order to progress, customize, and optimize their experience in Super Galactic.

These systems are designed to scale naturally with player advancement. As players earn more, progress further, and engage more deeply with the game, UAP consumption increases proportionally. This ensures that increased activity is matched by corresponding token demand.

Token sinks form the primary counterbalance to reward distribution within the closed-loop economy.

---

## Purpose of Token Sinks

Token sinks serve several critical roles within the game economy:

- Support long-term progression systems
- Regulate circulating UAP as player activity increases
- Reinforce meaningful decision-making around upgrades and growth
- Align reward issuance with sustained gameplay engagement

By tying UAP spending directly to gameplay value, token sinks ensure that rewards earned through missions flow back into the core progression loop.

## Core Progression-Based Sinks

UAP is consumed through several key gameplay systems tied to progression and advancement.

These sinks are not optional penalties. They are integrated progression mechanics that unlock deeper gameplay, stronger performance, and expanded customization.

---

## Upgrades and Enhancements

Players spend UAP to improve characters, equipment, and performance-related attributes.

Common upgrade paths include:

- Stat upgrades and power scaling
- Equipment enhancement and optimization
- Progression unlocks tied to gameplay depth

Upgrade costs scale as players advance, increasing UAP demand alongside progression rather than front-loading consumption.

---

## Breeding and Creation Systems

Certain gameplay systems require UAP to create or enhance playable assets.

Key characteristics:

- UAP is consumed at the point of execution
- Costs are configurable to maintain balance and accessibility
- Breeding represents a deliberate, high-impact spend

These systems act as deeper commitment sinks that support long-term engagement and asset diversity without encouraging excessive repetition.

Detailed breeding mechanics are documented separately under **NFTs & Assets → Breeding System**.

## Optional Unlocks and Customization

Additional token sinks may include optional gameplay unlocks or customization paths.

Examples include:

- Unlocking new gameplay options
- Cosmetic or progression-related customization
- Optional enhancements tied to player choice

These sinks allow players to personalize their experience while contributing to overall UAP circulation control.

---

## Scaling and Balance

Token sinks are intentionally designed to scale with progression rather than time.

- Early progression requires lower UAP spend
- Advanced progression introduces higher-cost decisions
- Sink intensity increases alongside reward potential

As a result, experienced players naturally contribute more to UAP consumption as they progress deeper into the game.

---

## Relationship to Burn Mechanisms

All UAP spent through token sinks follows the allocation logic defined in the Game Economy.

- A portion of spent UAP is permanently burned
- The remaining portion is routed to the game treasury

Token sinks therefore act as the primary entry point for automated burn and treasury flows, directly linking gameplay activity to supply management.

Detailed burn logic is covered in **Game Economy → Burn Mechanisms**.

## Design Principles

Token sinks in Super Galactic are guided by the following principles:

- Spending should feel purposeful, not punitive
- Progression should require commitment, not grind
- Higher rewards should naturally lead to higher spend
- Sinks must scale without forcing participation

This approach ensures that UAP spending remains intuitive, fair, and aligned with long-term gameplay health.
