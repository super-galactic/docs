The Super Galactic rewards system is built around mission-based gameplay and is designed to reward skill, completion, and active participation while maintaining long-term economic balance.

Players earn **UAP** by completing missions across multiple planets. Rewards scale with mission difficulty and objective completion, ensuring progression remains fair, flexible, and resistant to abuse.

## Mission Structure

Super Galactic currently features **three planetary maps**, each generating missions dynamically.

- Missions are randomly generated per planet
- Each mission includes one or more objectives
- Objectives must be completed through active gameplay

This structure encourages replayability while preventing predictable farming patterns.

## Difficulty Levels and Rewards

Missions are available across five difficulty levels. Higher difficulty missions offer increased rewards and challenge.

| Difficulty Level | Base UAP Reward |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Level 1          | 100 UAP         |
| Level 2          | 150 UAP         |
| Level 3          | 250 UAP         |
| Level 4          | 350 UAP         |
| Level 5          | 500 UAP         |

Difficulty selection allows players to choose their preferred balance between risk, effort, and reward.

## Objective-Based Rewards

Mission rewards are calculated based on **objective completion**, not just mission selection.

- Completing all objectives grants the full reward for the selected difficulty
- Partial completion grants UAP for each completed objective
- Failed or incomplete objectives do not grant rewards

For example, selecting a Level 5 mission does not guarantee the full 500 UAP. Players are rewarded only for the objectives they successfully complete.

This system rewards performance and progress without forcing all-or-nothing outcomes.

## Daily Reward Limits

To maintain economic stability, mission rewards are subject to daily limits.

- Players can complete a limited number of reward-eligible missions per day
- Limits are configurable and may be adjusted to preserve balance
- This prevents excessive inflation while supporting consistent play

Daily limits apply across all planets and difficulty levels.

## In-Game Tracking and Visibility

All reward activity is tracked directly in-game.

Players can view:

- Current UAP balance
- Total UAP earned and spent
- Mission reward history
- Upgrade and spending activity

This provides clear visibility into progression and reward flow at all times.

## Claiming Rewards and System Integration

Mission completion data is recorded in-game and synchronized with the **Super Galactic Hub**.

- Missions are completed and tracked in-game
- Reward data is sent to the Gaming Hub and marketplace inventory
- Players claim earned UAP through the integrated system

This ensures consistency across gameplay, inventory management, and on-chain asset ownership.

## Spending and Progression

All upgrades and progression actions occur directly in-game.

- Earned UAP is spent on upgrades, breeding, and progression systems
- Spending follows the burn and reserve mechanics described in the Game Economy
- Progression actions are reflected across connected systems

This creates a seamless loop between gameplay, rewards, and advancement.

## Anti-Abuse Design

The rewards system includes multiple safeguards to protect fairness and balance.

- No passive or idle reward generation
- Objective-based rewards prevent speed farming
- Difficulty scaling discourages low-effort repetition
- Daily limits cap excessive reward extraction

These measures ensure rewards remain meaningful and skill-based.

## Design Philosophy

The Super Galactic rewards system is guided by the following principles:

- Active play should always be rewarded
- Higher challenge should offer higher potential rewards
- Partial progress should still be recognized
- Rewards must scale without destabilizing the economy

This approach supports long-term engagement while maintaining a sustainable and transparent reward structure.
