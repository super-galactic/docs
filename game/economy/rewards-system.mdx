Super Galactic’s reward system is designed to distribute UAP exclusively through **active, skill-based gameplay**.

There are no emissions detached from play, no idle farming, and no passive reward loops. Every UAP token earned by players is the result of meaningful in-game activity.

This ensures that token distribution remains controlled, fair, and directly aligned with player engagement.

### Activity-Bound Rewards

UAP rewards are earned by completing missions within the game.

Key principles of the reward system:

- Rewards are generated by player activity, not the passage of time
- No idle or passive earning mechanics
- No automated emissions without gameplay input

UAP only enters circulation when players actively participate in the game.

### Difficulty-Based Reward Scaling

Missions offer selectable difficulty levels, allowing players to choose their risk-to-reward profile.

- Higher difficulty missions offer higher potential rewards
- Increased challenge requires greater skill, preparation, and progression
- Players maintain control over how they engage with the economy

This structure rewards mastery and commitment rather than repetitive low-effort play.

### Proportional Rewards for Partial Completion

The reward system supports proportional outcomes.

- Partial mission completion still yields proportional rewards
- Players are not forced into all-or-nothing outcomes
- Time and effort are consistently respected

This design reduces frustration while preserving fairness and economic balance.

### Controlled Entry Into Circulation

The reward system does not mint new tokens.

All UAP distributed as rewards already exists within the fixed total supply. The system only determines **when and how existing supply enters circulation** based on gameplay activity.

This prevents runaway inflation while still supporting healthy reward flow for active players.

### Earning Limits and Mission Cooldowns

To preserve long-term economic balance, reward generation is governed by **mission-level cooldowns**, not unlimited repetition.

Each PvE mission completed enters a **24-hour cooldown** starting immediately after completion.\
Cooldowns apply **per mission**, not globally.

As a result:

- A single Genesis Origin UFOep can earn UAP from **up to 5 PvE missions within a rolling 24-hour window**
- Missions reset individually based on their completion time
- Gameplay remains unlimited, but reward generation is paced

This structure prevents excessive extraction while rewarding consistent, skill-based participation.

### Relationship to the Broader Economy

The Rewards System is one side of the closed-loop economy.

- Rewards introduce UAP into player hands
- Progression systems create demand through spending
- Spending triggers automated burns and treasury flows

Together, these systems ensure that increased engagement strengthens the economy rather than destabilizing it.

### Why This Matters

By binding rewards directly to gameplay:

- Skilled players are rewarded fairly
- Token distribution remains sustainable
- Supply growth is controlled and predictable
- Economic value is rooted in participation, not speculation

This approach aligns player incentives with long-term ecosystem health.
