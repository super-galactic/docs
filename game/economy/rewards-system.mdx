Super Galactic’s reward system is designed to be **gameplay-first**, **skill-driven**, and **economically sustainable**. UAP rewards are earned exclusively through active participation in eligible gameplay modes and are never generated through passive activity, idle mechanics, or speculative emissions.

The system deliberately avoids the inflationary reward structures seen in early Play-to-Earn models by tying every reward to measurable in-game performance, fixed difficulty caps, and controlled entry into circulation.

### How UAP Is Earned

UAP enters circulation **only through successful PvE mission completion**.

Players earn UAP by:

- Completing missions
- Fulfilling mission objectives
- Playing at higher difficulty levels
- Performing effectively during combat encounters

There are **no rewards for idle play**, login bonuses, or automated yield systems. Every token earned reflects real gameplay activity.

### Performance-Based Reward Calculation

UAP rewards are bounded by mission difficulty and determined by objective completion, not by stat-based multipliers.

Each mission difficulty defines a **fixed maximum UAP reward**. Players qualify for this maximum only by successfully completing all mission objectives. Partial completion results in reduced rewards based on system calculation.

Player progression improves **the ability to successfully complete higher difficulty missions**, not the reward caps themselves.

Performance is influenced by:

- **Genesis character rating**, which increases survivability and overall combat effectiveness
- **Weapon ratings**, which improve damage output and combat efficiency
- **Combat execution**, including objective completion and mission success

Upgrading Genesis characters and weapons increases ratings and underlying stats, enabling players to perform more consistently at higher difficulty levels. These upgrades do **not** increase maximum rewards or multiply UAP output.

This structure ensures access to higher reward tiers scales with skill and preparation without introducing inflationary mechanics.

### Mission Difficulty and Reward Caps

Super Galactic missions are distributed across multiple planetary maps, each offering randomized mission objectives and selectable difficulty levels.

Each difficulty level defines a **maximum UAP reward**, which can only be achieved by completing all mission objectives. Higher difficulties offer higher reward caps but require stronger performance and preparation.

> _Planet selection and mission objectives are randomized, while reward caps remain consistent per difficulty level._

| Mission Difficulty | Maximum UAP Reward |
| :----------------- | :----------------- |
| Difficulty 1       | Up to 100 UAP      |
| Difficulty 2       | Up to 150 UAP      |
| Difficulty 3       | Up to 250 UAP      |
| Difficulty 4       | Up to 350 UAP      |
| Difficulty 5       | Up to 500 UAP      |

<Note>
  Maximum rewards are granted only when all mission objectives are completed. Partial completion results in reduced rewards based on system calculation.

### Reward Eligibility by Game Mode

PvP and demo modes are designed for competition, testing, and learning and do not generate token rewards.

| Game Mode                   | Eligible for UAP Rewards |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| PvE Missions (Play to Earn) | Yes                      |
| Demo Mode                   | No                       |
| Duel (PvP)                  | No                       |
| Team Deathmatch (PvP)       | No                       |
| Social / Practice Play      | No                       |

### Reward Balancing and Live Configuration

Super Galactic’s reward system is configurable to support long term balance and live operations.

Reward values, difficulty tuning, and mission parameters can be adjusted based on gameplay analytics and observed player behaviour. This allows the system to respond to real usage patterns while preserving its core design principles.

Adjustments are used to maintain balance, fairness, and sustainability and do not introduce token minting, inflationary emissions, or passive reward systems within the fixed supply model.

<Note>
  Any changes to reward configuration are communicated transparently and in advance through official development updates.

### Earn vs Claim

UAP is **earned in game** but **claimed through the Super Galactic Hub**.

- Mission completion records earned UAP off chain
- Rewards become visible in the in game account overview
- Players claim accumulated rewards through the hub
- On chain settlement occurs at claim

This separation allows precise reward tracking while minimising on chain activity and preventing abuse.

```java
Select mission difficulty
        ↓
Complete objectives
        ↓
Earn UAP (off-chain)
        ↓
Claim via Hub (on-chain)
```

### Controlled Entry Into Circulation

The reward system does not mint new tokens.

All UAP distributed as rewards already exists within the fixed total supply. The system only determines **when and how existing supply enters circulation** based on gameplay activity.

This prevents runaway inflation while still supporting healthy reward flow for active players.

### Earning Limits and Mission Cooldowns

To preserve long-term economic balance, reward generation is governed by **mission-level cooldowns**, not unlimited repetition.

Each PvE mission completed enters a **24-hour cooldown** starting immediately after completion.\
Cooldowns apply **per mission**, not globally.

As a result:

- A single Genesis Origin UFOep can earn UAP from **up to 5 PvE missions within a rolling 24-hour window**
- Missions reset individually based on their completion time
- Gameplay remains unlimited, but reward generation is paced

This structure prevents excessive extraction while rewarding consistent, skill-based participation.

### Rewards and Long-Term Balance

Earned UAP is primarily intended to be **reinvested into progression**:

- Upgrading Genesis characters
- Upgrading weapon NFTs
- Preparing for future systems such as breeding

Every upgrade permanently consumes UAP and contributes to automatic supply reduction through burn mechanisms.

By requiring reinvestment to unlock deeper progression, the rewards system supports long-term balance and avoids extractive reward behaviour.

### Relationship to the Broader Economy

The Rewards System is one side of the closed-loop economy.

- Rewards introduce UAP into player hands
- Progression systems create demand through spending
- Spending triggers automated burns and treasury flows

Together, these systems ensure that increased engagement strengthens the economy rather than destabilizing it.

Details on progression spending and burns are covered in: [**Token Sinks**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/token-sinks) & [**Burn Mechanisms**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/burn-mechanisms)

### Why This Matters

By binding rewards directly to gameplay:

- Skilled players are rewarded fairly
- Token distribution remains sustainable
- Supply growth is controlled and predictable
- Economic value is rooted in participation, not speculation

This approach aligns player incentives with long-term ecosystem health.
