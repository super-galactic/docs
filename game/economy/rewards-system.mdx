The Rewards System defines how UAP enters player circulation through gameplay and the constraints that govern extraction. Rewards are generated only through eligible PvE gameplay and are bounded by mission caps, cooldowns, and per asset limits.

There are no passive rewards, time based emissions, or account level reward guarantees.

### Eligible Gameplay

UAP rewards are generated through PvE missions only. PvP and demo modes are designed for competition, testing, and learning and do not generate token rewards:

| Game Mode                   | Eligible for UAP Rewards |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| PvE Missions (Play to Earn) | Yes                      |
| Demo Mode                   | No                       |
| Duel (PvP)                  | No                       |
| Team Deathmatch (PvP)       | No                       |

These modes are progression neutral and reward neutral.

### Reward Generation Rules

UAP rewards are generated when a PvE mission is successfully completed.

Reward generation requires:

- Mission completion
- Completion of required objectives
- Selection of an eligible difficulty tier

Difficulty defines the **maximum reward cap** for that mission. Partial completion results in reduced rewards based on system calculation.

Progression and upgrades improve consistency at higher difficulties but do not increase reward caps.

### Mission Difficulty and Reward Caps

Each PvE mission difficulty tier defines a fixed maximum UAP reward

| Mission Difficulty | Maximum UAP Reward |
| :----------------- | :----------------- |
| Difficulty 1       | Up to 100 UAP      |
| Difficulty 2       | Up to 150 UAP      |
| Difficulty 3       | Up to 250 UAP      |
| Difficulty 4       | Up to 350 UAP      |
| Difficulty 5       | Up to 500 UAP      |

Maximum rewards are granted only when all mission objectives are completed successfully.

### Earn vs Claim

UAP is **earned off chain** and **claimed on chain**.

- Mission completion records earned UAP off chain
- Earned rewards become visible in the player account
- Players claim accumulated UAP through the Super Galactic Hub
- On chain settlement occurs only at claim

This separation allows accurate reward tracking while minimising on chain execution.

### Reward Extraction Limits

Reward extraction is governed by mission level cooldowns and per asset limits.

- Each PvE mission enters a cooldown after completion
- Cooldowns apply per mission, not globally
- The cooldown window is **24 hours**, rolling from mission completion time

Within a rolling 24 hour window:

- A single Genesis Origin UFOep can generate rewards from **up to five PvE missions**
- Gameplay is unlimited, reward extraction is capped

This structure limits extraction without restricting play.

### Per Genesis Scaling Rules

Reward limits apply **per Genesis character**, not per account.

- Each Genesis has its own mission cooldowns
- Each Genesis has its own five mission reward limit per rolling 24 hour window
- Owning additional Genesis increases total reward capacity linearly

There is no account level reward cap.

### Supply Discipline

The Rewards System does not mint new tokens.

All UAP distributed as rewards already exists within the fixed total supply. Rewards introduce existing supply into circulation based on gameplay outcomes, not time or participation volume.

### System Constraints

The Rewards System enforces the following constraints:

- Rewards require active gameplay
- Reward extraction is capped and paced
- Difficulty defines reward ceilings
- Progression does not inflate rewards
- No idle, automated, or passive rewards

These constraints ensure that rewards remain predictable, auditable, and economically sustainable over long term operation.
