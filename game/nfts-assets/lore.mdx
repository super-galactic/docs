Super Galactic is not a world you observe. It is a world you enter.

Every Genesis carries history, conflict, and intent, but none of it is complete without a pilot. Power exists here, but it does nothing on its own. It waits to be directed, tested, and pushed beyond its limits. Progression is not given. It is earned through decisions, upgrades, and the willingness to take responsibility for what your Genesis becomes.

This universe does not reward spectators. It responds to action.
