</Card>

The Super Galactic Hub is the application interface through which ownership-enabled actions and on-chain settlement are executed. It coordinates gameplay outcomes with asset ownership and economic settlement, without executing gameplay logic itself. Progression and upgrades occur in the game client. The Hub is used to approve and settle UAP-based actions, including reward claims, marketplace listing, bidding, auctions, purchases, and other ownership-related transactions.
