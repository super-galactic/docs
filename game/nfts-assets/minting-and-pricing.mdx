Genesis Origin UFOeps and Mystery Lootboxes can be minted through the Super Galactic Hub Marketplace. Create a Hub account, connect a supported wallet, and complete the mint transaction on a supported network.

For what Genesis are and what they unlock in gameplay, see **The Originals**. For lootbox contents and weapon systems, see **Mystery Lootboxes** and **Equipment & Weapons**.

### Acquiring Genesis NFTs

Genesis are minted through the **Super Galactic Hub Marketplace**. After creating an account, users can mint directly from the Hub interface.

Mint access is available at:\
https://app.ufogaming.io/mint?type=nft_soldier

### Genesis Mint Pricing

Genesis minting follows a tiered pricing structure based on total supply minted.

| Supply Range   | Mint Price |
| :------------- | :--------- |
| 1 – 3,000      | \$250      |
| 3,001 – 7,000  | \$275      |
| 7,001 – 10,000 | \$300      |

Pricing increases as supply thresholds are reached, reflecting fixed supply distribution across the Genesis mint.

### Genesis Rarity Drop (Per Body Part)

When minting a Genesis, rarity is assigned independently to each of its six body parts at the point of mint. This means a single Genesis can contain a mix of rarities across its parts, which affects base stats, upgrade caps, and rating potential.

Rarity is rolled per body part and is not tied to the Genesis class itself. Two Genesis from the same class may share a similar visual base, but differ in body part rarity distribution, stats, and rating.

Rarity tiers and drop rates per body part are documented below.

| Rarity   | Drop Rate |
| :------- | :-------- |
| Common   | 68%       |
| Uncommon | 30%       |
| Rare     | 1.8%      |
| Epic     | 0.2%      |

For how rarity affects upgrade caps and rating potential, see **Rarity, Attributes & Rating**.

### Acquiring Mystery Lootboxes

Mystery Lootboxes can be acquired through the [**Super Galactic Hub Marketplace**](https://app.ufogaming.io/). After creating an account, users can mint lootboxes directly from the Hub.

Lootboxes represent unopened items. Their contents are not visible or usable in-game until the lootbox is opened.

Lootbox mint access is available at:\
https://app.ufogaming.io/mint?type=nft_item

For details on lootbox contents, reveal mechanics, and item usage, see **Mystery Lootboxes**.

#### Lootbox Ownership and Reveal

After purchase, a Mystery Lootbox is delivered to your Super Galactic Hub inventory, and the action is recorded in Hub Activity.

- **Before opening:** the lootbox is an owned asset in the Hub. It can be held or transferred without revealing its contents.
- **When opened:** the lootbox is consumed and a weapon NFT is revealed and assigned permanently (type, rarity, attributes, rating, stats and any perks if applicable).

In the game client, Genesis characters and revealed weapon NFTs are detected when you connect the wallet you used in the Hub. Unopened lootboxes remain in the Hub until they are opened.

### Lootbox Gifting

Lootboxes can be gifted at purchase by specifying a recipient wallet address. Ownership transfers to the recipient, and the action is recorded in the Super Galactic Hub Activity history.

### Lootbox Pricing

Mystery Lootbox pricing follows a tiered model based on total supply sold. Pricing increases as more lootboxes are minted, reflecting fixed supply progression.

| Supply Sold    | Price per Lootbox |
| :------------- | :---------------- |
| 0 – 3,000      | \$25              |
| 3,001 – 7,000  | \$30              |
| 7,001 – 10,000 | \$35              |

### Lootbox Rarity Drop

The contents of a Mystery Lootbox are determined only when the lootbox is opened. Rarity is not assigned at the time of purchase. Opening a lootbox generates a randomised weapon outcome. Weapons may be melee or ranged, and rarity is assigned at reveal based on predefined distribution.

| Rarity   | Drop Rate |
| :------- | :-------- |
| Common   | 68%       |
| Uncommon | 30%       |
| Rare     | 1.8%      |
| Epic     | 0.2%      |
