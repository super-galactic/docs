Minting and pricing define how Genesis Origin NFTs and Mystery Lootboxes are issued, priced, and constrained at the point of mint. This page is parameter focused and describes enforced system behavior only.

This page defines the **current minting parameters and pricing configuration**. All values and rules listed here apply to the live configuration on BNB Chain.

### Network and Settlement

All minting activity is executed on BNB Chain.

On chain execution covers:

- Minting and issuance
- Rarity assignment
- Supply enforcement

### Supported Currencies

Supported mint payment currencies: BNB, BUSD, USDC. Prices shown on this page are USD equivalents. BNB is required for network gas fees during mint execution.

### Genesis Origin Minting

Genesis Origin UFOeps are minted directly as NFTs with predefined supply constraints.

- Total Genesis supply is fixed
- Each Genesis is minted as a complete character composed of multiple body parts
- Minting assigns body part composition and rarity at execution

Genesis minting does not guarantee specific rarity outcomes.

### Genesis Mint Pricing

Genesis Origin minting uses a tier based pricing model.

Pricing is defined across sequential mint tiers. Each tier specifies:

- Mint price per Genesis
- Maximum number of Genesis available in that tier

Once a tier is exhausted, minting progresses to the next tier automatically. Pricing applies at execution based on the active tier at the time of mint.

| Supply Range   | Mint Price |
| :------------- | :--------- |
| 1 – 3,000      | \$250      |
| 3,001 – 7,000  | \$275      |
| 7,001 – 10,000 | \$300      |

Tier parameters are enforced by the minting contract and cannot be bypassed.

### Genesis Supply Constraints

- Total Genesis Origin supply: 10,000
- Supply is divided evenly across Origins
- Once supply is exhausted, no additional Genesis can be minted

Supply limits are enforced by smart contract logic.

### Mystery Lootbox Minting

Mystery Lootboxes are minted as container assets representing unrevealed weapon NFTs.

- Each lootbox represents exactly one weapon
- Weapon assignment occurs only at reveal
- Lootboxes are independent assets until opened

Lootbox minting does not assign weapon type or rarity at mint.

### Mystery Lootbox Pricing

Mystery Lootbox minting also uses a **tier based pricing model**.

Pricing is defined across sequential mint tiers. Each tier specifies:

- Mint price per lootbox
- Maximum number of lootboxes available in that tier

Once a tier is exhausted, minting progresses to the next tier automatically. Pricing applies at execution based on the active tier at the time of mint.

| Supply Sold    | Price per Lootbox |
| :------------- | :---------------- |
| 0 – 3,000      | \$25              |
| 3,001 – 7,000  | \$30              |
| 7,001 – 10,000 | \$35              |

Tier progression and pricing enforcement are handled at the system level.

### Weapon Supply Constraints

Weapon supply is fixed and enforced across all lootbox mints.

- Total weapon types are capped
- Each weapon type has a maximum supply
- Once a weapon type reaches its cap, it is removed from the drop pool

Supply enforcement is handled at the system level.

### Rarity Drop Rates

Rarity assignment for Genesis body parts and weapon NFTs is executed through **smart contract logic**.

- Rarity is **randomised at mint or reveal**
- Assignment is **final and immutable**
- No post mint or post reveal modification is possible

Genesis NFTs may contain a mix of body part rarities. Weapon NFTs receive a single rarity at reveal.

Rarity drop rate tables define the probability distribution used by the system at execution.

| Rarity   | Drop Rate |
| :------- | :-------- |
| Common   | 68%       |
| Uncommon | 30%       |
| Rare     | 1.8%      |
| Epic     | 0.2%      |

### Wallet Limits and Enforcement

Minting limits are enforced at execution.

- Maximum 10 mints per transaction

Limits are applied by the minting contract and cannot be bypassed through repeated transactions or batching.
