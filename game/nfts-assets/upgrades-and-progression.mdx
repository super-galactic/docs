Upgrades define how Genesis characters and weapon NFTs improve over time through deterministic progression rules. This page specifies what can be upgraded, how upgrades are applied, and the constraints that govern upgrade depth.

### **Genesis and Weapon Upgrades**

Both Genesis characters and weapon NFTs can be upgraded using UAP.

**Genesis upgrades**

- Apply to individual body parts
- Increase stats, rating, and visual evolution
- Scale by rarity and level

**Weapon upgrades**

- Apply to melee and ranged weapons
- Increase combat effectiveness and rating
- Unlock higher performance at higher rarities

Upgrading Genesis characters and weapons increases ratings and underlying stats, enabling more consistent performance at higher difficulty levels. These upgrades do not increase maximum rewards or multiply UAP output.

### What Can Be Upgraded

- **Genesis body parts:** Head, Arms, Chest, Backpack, Legs, Ears
- **Weapons:** Melee weapons and ranged weapons

Each upgraded component contributes to overall rating and combat performance.

### Upgrade Caps by Rarity

Upgrade limits are determined by rarity:

- Common and Uncommon: up to Level 4
- Rare and Epic: up to Level 5

Costs scale progressively with both rarity and level, ensuring that higher tier progression represents meaningful investment.

### Upgrade Cost Scaling

Upgrade costs scale by rarity and upgrade level, applying equally to Genesis body parts and weapon NFTs. This ensures early progression is accessible, while higher tier optimisation requires meaningful commitment.

#### Genesis Body Part Upgrade Cost Scaling

| Rarity   | Upgrade Levels | Body Part Cost  |
| :------- | :------------- | :-------------- |
| Common   | Level 1 → 4    | 1,000 → 60,000  |
| Uncommon | Level 1 → 4    | 1,200 → 80,000  |
| Rare     | Level 1 → 5    | 1,500 → 100,000 |
| Epic     | Level 1 → 5    | 2,000 → 160,000 |

#### Weapon Upgrade Cost Scaling

| Rarity   | Upgrade Levels | Ranged Weapon Cost | Melee Weapon Cost |
| -------- | -------------- | :----------------- | :---------------- |
| Common   | Level 1 → 4    | 2,000 → 120,000    | 1,500 → 90,000    |
| Uncommon | Level 1 → 4    | 2,400 → 160,000    | 1,800 → 120,000   |
| Rare     | Level 1 → 5    | 3,000 → 200,000    | 2,250 → 150,000   |
| Epic     | Level 1 → 5    | 4,000 → 320,000    | 3,000 → 240,000   |

<Note>
  Upgrade costs and parameters may be adjusted over time to support long-term balance and player activity. Any material changes will be communicated through official development updates.

### Economic Integration

Upgrades are a primary progression sink. Each upgrade consumes UAP and follows the burn and Game Treasury split defined in [Burn Mechanisms](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/burn-mechanisms), linking long-term progression directly to usage-based supply reduction.

### Progression with Purpose

Upgrades are the core long-term progression path. They increase performance, evolve visuals, and raise rating, while costs scale with rarity and level to keep progression decisions meaningful as players advance.
