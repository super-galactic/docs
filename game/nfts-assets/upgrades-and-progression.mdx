Upgrades and progression in Super Galactic are designed to reward long term commitment while actively supporting economic balance. Every upgrade enhances gameplay performance, visual identity, and rating, while contributing to a sustainable Play to Earn economy.

Progression is powered by **UAP**, which functions as the core in game utility and balancing token.

### **Genesis and Weapon Upgrades**

Both Genesis characters and weapon NFTs can be upgraded using UAP.

- **Genesis upgrades**
  - Apply to individual body parts
  - Increase stats, rating, and visual evolution
  - Scale by rarity and level
- **Weapon upgrades**
  - Apply to melee and ranged weapons
  - Increase combat effectiveness and rating
  - Unlock higher performance at higher rarities

Upgrade limits are determined by rarity:

- Common and Uncommon: up to Level 4
- Rare and Epic: up to Level 5

Costs scale progressively with both rarity and level, ensuring that higher tier progression represents meaningful investment.

### **Upgrade Cost Scaling**

Upgrade costs scale by **rarity** and **upgrade level**, applying equally to Genesis body parts and weapon NFTs. This ensures early progression is accessible, while higher tier optimisation requires meaningful commitment.

| Rarity   | Upgrade Levels | Body Part Cost  | Ranged Weapon Cost | Melee Weapon Cost |
| :------- | :------------- | :-------------- | :----------------- | :---------------- |
| Common   | Level 1 → 4    | 1,000 → 60,000  | 2,000 → 120,000    | 1,500 → 90,000    |
| Uncommon | Level 1 → 4    | 1,200 → 80,000  | 2,400 → 160,000    | 1,800 → 120,000   |
| Rare     | Level 1 → 5    | 1,500 → 100,000 | 3,000 → 200,000    | 2,250 → 150,000   |
| Epic     | Level 1 → 5    | 2,000 → 160,000 | 4,000 → 320,000    | 3,000 → 240,000   |

<Note>
  Upgrade costs and parameters may be adjusted over time to support long term economic balance, player activity, and sustainability. Any changes will be implemented carefully and communicated transparently to the community in advance.

### **Burn Mechanics and Reserve Allocation**

Every upgrade triggers an automatic and transparent UAP distribution mechanism:

- **50% of the UAP used is permanently burned**
- **50% is sent to a reserve wallet**

For example:

- If an upgrade costs **120,000 UAP**
  - **60,000 UAP is burned automatically**
  - **60,000 UAP is allocated to the reserve wallet**

This system serves multiple purposes:

- Continuous reduction of circulating supply
- Built in inflation control
- Flexibility to stabilise the Play to Earn economy

### **Reserve Wallet Purpose**

The reserve wallet exists to support long term economic health.

Funds allocated to the reserve may be:

- Burned manually if required
- Reintroduced into the Play to Earn reward pool
- Used to stabilise emissions during periods of high activity

Any actions involving the reserve will be communicated transparently to the community.

This hybrid approach combines automatic deflation with controlled flexibility, allowing the economy to adapt without introducing unchecked inflation.

### **Progression with Purpose**

Upgrading assets is not just about power. It is a commitment to progression, mastery, and the long term health of the ecosystem.

Every upgrade:

- Improves gameplay
- Enhances visual identity
- Increases rating
- Contributes to economic balance

Progression in Super Galactic is designed to be meaningful, transparent, and sustainable by default.
