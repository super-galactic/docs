Upgrades define how Genesis characters and weapon NFTs improve over time through deterministic progression rules. This page specifies what can be upgraded, how upgrades are applied, upgrade caps, and cost scaling behavior.

### Genesis and Weapon Upgrades

Upgrades apply to two asset types:

- **Genesis upgrades** apply to individual body parts on a Genesis Origin UFOep
- **Weapon upgrades** apply to melee and ranged weapon NFTs

Upgrading increases stats and rating, improving combat performance and progression consistency at higher difficulty tiers. Upgrades do not increase reward caps or multiply UAP output.

### What Can Be Upgraded

- **Genesis body parts:** Head, Arms, Chest, Backpack, Legs, Ears
- **Weapons:** Melee weapons and ranged weapons

Each body part is upgraded independently. Upgrading one body part does not change the upgrade state of other parts. Each weapon is upgraded independently.

### Upgrade Levels

- Upgrades start at **Level 0**
- Levels increase sequentially
- Maximum level is determined by rarity caps

### Upgrade Caps by Rarity

| Rarity                                        | Maximum Upgrade Level |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| <Badge color="white">White (Common)</Badge>   | Level 4               |
| <Badge color="green">Green (Uncommon)</Badge> | Level 4               |
| <Badge color="blue">Blue (Rare)</Badge>       | Level 5               |
| <Badge color="purple">Purple (Epic)</Badge>   | Level 5               |

These caps apply uniformly across Genesis body parts and weapon NFTs.

### Upgrade Cost Scaling

Upgrade costs scale by rarity and upgrade level, applying equally to Genesis body parts and weapon NFTs. This ensures early progression is accessible, while higher tier optimisation requires meaningful commitment.

#### Genesis Body Part Upgrade Cost Scaling

| Rarity   | Upgrade Levels | Body Part Cost  |
| :------- | :------------- | :-------------- |
| Common   | Level 1 → 4    | 1,000 → 60,000  |
| Uncommon | Level 1 → 4    | 1,200 → 80,000  |
| Rare     | Level 1 → 5    | 1,500 → 100,000 |
| Epic     | Level 1 → 5    | 2,000 → 160,000 |

| Rarity | Upgrade Levels | Body Part Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <Badge color="white">White (Common)</Badge> | Level 1 → 4 | 1,000 → 60,000 |
| <Badge color="green">Green (Uncommon)</Badge> | Level 1 → 4 | 1,200 → 80,000 |
| <Badge color="blue">Blue (Rare)</Badge> | Level 1 → 5 | 1,500 → 100,000 |
| <Badge color="purple">Purple (Epic)</Badge> | Level 1 → 5 | 2,000 → 160,000 |

#### Weapon Upgrade Cost Scaling

| Rarity   | Upgrade Levels | Ranged Weapon Cost | Melee Weapon Cost |
| -------- | -------------- | :----------------- | :---------------- |
| Common   | Level 1 → 4    | 2,000 → 120,000    | 1,500 → 90,000    |
| Uncommon | Level 1 → 4    | 2,400 → 160,000    | 1,800 → 120,000   |
| Rare     | Level 1 → 5    | 3,000 → 200,000    | 2,250 → 150,000   |
| Epic     | Level 1 → 5    | 4,000 → 320,000    | 3,000 → 240,000   |

| Rarity | Upgrade Levels | Ranged Weapon Cost | Melee Weapon Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <Badge color="white">White (Common)</Badge> | Level 1 → 4 | 2,000 → 120,000 | 1,500 → 90,000 |
| <Badge color="green">Green (Uncommon)</Badge> | Level 1 → 4 | 2,400 → 160,000 | 1,800 → 120,000 |
| <Badge color="blue">Blue (Rare)</Badge> | Level 1 → 5 | 3,000 → 200,000 | 2,250 → 150,000 |
| <Badge color="purple">Purple (Epic)</Badge> | Level 1 → 5 | 4,000 → 320,000 | 3,000 → 240,000 |

### Visual Progression

Progression is component based. When a body part or weapon is upgraded, the associated 3D model updates to reflect the upgrade state, even if other components remain unchanged.

### Configurable Cost Parameters

Upgrade costs are configurable system parameters used to maintain progression pacing and player affordability relative to UAP market value.

Configuration does not modify:

- Upgrade caps or rarity limits
- Reward ceilings or extraction limits
- Burn execution and Game Treasury routing

### Constraints and Boundaries

- Upgrades improve combat performance and progression consistency
- Upgrades do not increase reward caps
- Upgrade depth is bounded by rarity caps
- Costs scale by rarity and upgrade level

### Scope and References

- Rarity behavior and rating construction: **Rarity, Attributes & Rating**
- Weapon structure and perks: **Equipment & Weapons**
- Reward rules and extraction limits: Economy → **Rewards System**
- UAP spending sinks and burn execution: Economy → **Token Sinks** and **Burn Mechanisms**
