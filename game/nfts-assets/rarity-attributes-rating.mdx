Rarity, attributes, and rating define how a Genesis performs and how far it can progress. These systems create meaningful variation between characters and support long-term build decisions through upgrades.

Each Genesis starts with a distinct trait and stat profile at mint, then evolves through body part upgrades over time.

### Rarity System

Each Genesis is composed of six body parts, and each part is assigned an independent rarity level:

- Common
- Uncommon
- Rare
- Epic

Rarity influences:

- Base stats
- Upgrade caps
- Visual design
- Maximum rating potential

Higher rarity body parts unlock deeper progression paths and stronger long term performance. For Genesis rarity drop rates at mint, see **Minting & Pricing**.

### **Attribute Composition**

Every Genesis is minted with a fully randomised set of attributes. These attributes govern combat effectiveness and playstyle, and include:

- Power
- Duration
- Range
- Efficiency
- Health Points
- Shield Points
- Shield Regeneration
- Energy
- Reload Speed
- Critical Chance
- Critical Damage

Attribute combinations create meaningful differences between characters, encouraging experimentation and specialisation rather than uniform builds.

### Rating System

Rating is a composite value that reflects a Genesis character’s overall strength and progression level.

Rating is influenced by:

- Body part rarity
- Attribute distribution
- Upgrade levels across body parts

As rating increases, combat performance improves, and players can perform more consistently at higher mission difficulty tiers.

For upgrade mechanics and cost scaling, see [Upgrades & Progression.](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/nfts-assets/upgrades-and-progression)\
For reward caps and eligibility rules, see [Rewards System](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/rewards-system).

### **Rarity and Upgrade Caps**

Rarity directly affects how far a Genesis can be upgraded:

- Common and Uncommon body parts can be upgraded up to Level 4
- Rare and Epic body parts can be upgraded up to Level 5

This design ensures that higher rarity characters retain long-term value while still allowing meaningful progression for all Genesis owners.

### **Visual Evolution**

Progression is not only numerical. As Genesis are upgraded, their visual appearance evolves to reflect their growth and power. Enhanced effects, refined details, and stronger visual presence reinforce the connection between gameplay investment and character identity.

Players can see progression at a glance, both in and out of combat.
