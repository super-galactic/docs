Rarity and attributes define the identity and potential of every Genesis Origin UFOep. These systems ensure that progression is earned, builds are diverse, and no two characters play the same.

From the moment a Genesis is minted, its composition establishes a unique starting point that can be refined and enhanced through gameplay.

### **Rarity System**

Each Genesis is composed of six body parts, and each part is assigned an independent rarity level:

- **Common**
- **Uncommon**
- **Rare**
- **Epic**

Rarity influences:

- Base stats
- Upgrade caps
- Visual design
- Maximum rating potential

Higher rarity body parts unlock deeper progression paths and stronger long term performance.

### **Attribute Composition**

Every Genesis is minted with a fully randomized set of attributes. These attributes govern combat effectiveness and playstyle, and include:

- Power
- Duration
- Range
- Efficiency
- Health Points
- Shield Points
- Shield Regeneration
- Energy
- Reload Speed
- Critical Chance
- Critical Damage

Attribute combinations create meaningful differences between characters, encouraging experimentation and specialization rather than uniform builds.

### **Rating System**

The **rating** is a composite value that reflects a Genesis character’s overall strength and progression level.

Rating is influenced by:

- Body part rarity
- Attribute distribution
- Upgrade levels across body parts

As rating increases:

- Combat performance improves
- PvE efficiency increases
- UAP earning potential improves

Rating provides a clear and transparent measure of progression, allowing players to track growth and compare performance over time.

### **Rarity and Upgrade Caps**

Rarity directly affects how far a Genesis can be upgraded:

- **Common and Uncommon** body parts can be upgraded up to **Level 4**
- **Rare and Epic** body parts can be upgraded up to **Level 5**

This design ensures that higher rarity characters retain long term value while still allowing meaningful progression for all Genesis owners.

### **Visual Evolution**

Progression is not only numerical. As Genesis are upgraded, their visual appearance evolves to reflect their growth and power. Enhanced effects, refined details, and stronger visual presence reinforce the connection between gameplay investment and character identity.

Players can see progression at a glance, both in and out of combat.

### **Designed for Long Term Play**

Rarity, attributes, and rating work together to:

- Reward active participation
- Encourage strategic upgrades
- Support a sustainable Play to Earn economy
- Preserve long term asset value

Every Genesis begins as a foundation. Through progression, it becomes a personalised, battle tested character shaped by the player’s choices.
