### **Attribute Composition**

Every Genesis is minted with a fully randomised set of attributes. These attributes govern combat effectiveness and playstyle, and include:

- Power
- Duration
- Range
- Efficiency
- Health Points
- Shield Points
- Shield Regeneration
- Energy
- Reload Speed
- Critical Chance
- Critical Damage

Attribute combinations create meaningful differences between characters, encouraging experimentation and specialisation rather than uniform builds.

### Rating System

Rating is a composite value that reflects a Genesis character’s overall strength and progression level.

Rating is influenced by:

- Body part rarity
- Attribute distribution
- Upgrade levels across body parts

As rating increases, combat performance improves, and players can perform more consistently at higher mission difficulty tiers.
