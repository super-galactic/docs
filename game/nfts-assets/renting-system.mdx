The Renting System allows Genesis NFT owners to earn passive income by renting out their Genesis to other players, while enabling new players to access Play to Earn gameplay without owning a Genesis upfront.

Rentals are handled directly through the UFO Gaming Hub and enforced on chain using the **ERC-4907 rental standard**, ensuring security, transparency, and automatic ownership reversion.

### How Renting Works

Genesis owners can list their NFTs for rent with predefined terms, including rental duration and revenue share. Renters gain temporary usage rights to the Genesis, allowing them to play Super Galactic and earn UAP during the rental period.

All in game earnings generated during the rental are **automatically split** between the owner and the renter based on the agreed terms.

Once the rental period ends, usage rights **automatically revert back to the owner** without any manual action required.

### Key Benefits

**For Genesis Owners**

- Monetize idle Genesis NFTs
- Earn passive UAP rewards
- Retain full ownership at all times

**For Renters**

- Access Play to Earn without owning a Genesis
- Earn UAP through gameplay
- Lower barrier to entry into the ecosystem

### Smart Contract Enforcement

The Renting System is powered by ERC-4907, a standard designed specifically for NFT rentals.

- Genesis NFTs are time locked during the rental period
- Earnings are tracked and distributed automatically
- Usage rights expire on chain at the end of the rental
- Ownership is never transferred

<Note>
  **Note:** The rental contract enforces all terms trustlessly. Once a rental expires, the Genesis NFT automatically returns to the owner with no risk of loss or misuse.
</Note>

### Designed for Accessibility and Growth

The Renting System expands player participation while preserving Genesis scarcity. By allowing more players to enter the ecosystem, it increases overall activity, rewards distribution, and long term economic sustainability.

Renting is designed as an optional layer that complements ownership, not a replacement for it.
