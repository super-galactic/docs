The Renting System enables temporary delegation of Genesis NFT usage rights without transferring ownership. Rental terms are defined at listing and enforced for the duration of the rental period

Rentals are handled through the [Super Galactic Hub](https://app.ufogaming.io/) and enforced on-chain using the ERC-4907 rental standard, which supports temporary usage rights with automatic ownership reversion.

<Note>
  The Renting System is a planned feature and is scheduled to follow the Breeding System release. For timing and rollout details, see Roadmap.

### How Renting Works

Genesis owners can list a Genesis NFT for rent in the Super Galactic Hub with two fixed terms:

- Rental price (the upfront fee paid by the renter)
- Rental duration (the time window the renter can use the Genesis)

Ownership is never transferred. Only usage rights are granted for a fixed term.

When a renter accepts a listing:

1. The renter pays the rental fee for the listed duration
2. The renter receives temporary usage rights to the Genesis for the rental period
3. The renter can use the Genesis to access earning eligible PvE gameplay during the active rental window
4. When the rental period ends, usage rights expire automatically and revert to the owner

Rental does not mint new NFTs and does not create additional Genesis supply.

### Rental Pricing Signals (Optional)

Rental pricing is market-driven and typically reflects the Genesis strength and progression state.

Higher rating and stronger progression can increase rental demand because it supports more consistent performance in earning eligible PvE missions.

### Rental Roles and Constraints

**For Genesis owners**

- Retain full ownership at all times
- Define rental price and duration at listing
- Usage rights expire automatically at term end

**For renters**

- Receive time-limited usage rights only
- Access earning-eligible PvE during the rental window
- Rental does not convey ownership or asset controlWhen the rental expires, usage rights revert automatically to the owner

For earning rules and mission limits, see **Rewards System**.

### Smart Contract Enforcement

The Renting System is powered by ERC-4907, a standard designed specifically for NFT rentals.

- Usage rights are assigned on chain for a fixed duration
- Usage rights expire automatically at the end of the rental term
- Full ownership remains with the owner wallet throughout the rental period

Once a rental expires, usage rights revert automatically with no manual action required.

<Note>
  The rental contract enforces rental terms on chain.
