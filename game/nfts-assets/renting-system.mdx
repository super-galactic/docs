The Renting System allows Genesis NFT owners to earn passive income by renting out their Genesis to other players, while enabling new players to access Play to Earn gameplay without owning a Genesis upfront.

Rentals are handled directly through the UFO Gaming Hub and enforced on chain using the **ERC-4907 rental standard**, ensuring security, transparency, and automatic ownership reversion.

### How Renting Works

Genesis owners list an NFT for rent with predefined terms, including rental duration and the owner renter revenue share. Renters receive temporary usage rights to the Genesis for the rental period.

UAP earned during the rental period is split automatically based on the agreed terms. When the rental ends, usage rights revert to the owner automatically.

For earning rules and mission limits, see Rewards System.

### Key Benefits

**For Genesis owners**

- Rent out an owned Genesis while retaining ownership
- Receive a share of UAP earned during the rental period (based on the agreed split)
- Usage rights automatically revert when the rental ends

**For renters**

- Access earning eligible gameplay without owning a Genesis upfront
- Earn UAP during the rental period under the agreed split

### Smart Contract Enforcement

The Renting System is powered by ERC-4907, a standard designed specifically for NFT rentals.

- Genesis NFTs are time locked during the rental period
- Earnings are tracked and distributed automatically
- Usage rights expire on chain at the end of the rental
- Ownership is never transferred

<Note>
  The rental contract enforces all terms trustlessly.

  Once a rental expires, the Genesis NFT automatically returns to the owner with no risk of loss or misuse.

### Designed for Accessibility and Growth

The Renting System expands player participation while preserving Genesis scarcity. By allowing more players to enter the ecosystem, it increases overall activity, rewards distribution, and long term economic sustainability.

Renting is designed as an optional layer that complements ownership, not a replacement for it.

<Note>
  The Renting System is a planned feature and is scheduled to follow the Breeding System release. For timing and rollout details, see Roadmap.
