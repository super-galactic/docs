Weapons in Super Galactic are core gameplay assets that directly influence combat performance, progression speed, and build strategy. Unlike starter equipment, weapon NFTs are designed for long term use, upgrades, and optimisation.

Weapons are acquired primarily through **Mystery Lootboxes** and integrate directly with Genesis characters in PvE gameplay.

### **Weapon Categories**

Super Galactic weapons are divided into two categories. To participate in Play to Earn PvE gameplay, players must equip **one weapon from each category**.

| Category       | Description                                       | Requirement |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :---------- |
| Melee Weapons  | Close range combat, burst damage, utility effects | Required    |
| Ranged Weapons | Mid to long range combat, sustained DPS           | Required    |

<Note>
  Starter weapons are provided to all players for onboarding but are non NFT and non upgradable.
</Note>

### **Weapon Supply and Distribution**

Weapon supply is finite and tightly controlled.

| Item                       | Details                            |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Total Lootboxes            | 10,000                             |
| Weapons per Lootbox        | 1                                  |
| Total Weapon Types         | 10                                 |
| Ranged Weapons             | 6                                  |
| Melee Weapons              | 4                                  |
| Max Supply per Weapon Type | 1,000                              |
| Drop Pool Behavior         | Weapon removed once cap is reached |

<Note>
  Once a weapon type reaches its maximum supply, it is permanently removed from the drop pool. This ensures long term scarcity and prevents over saturation.
</Note>

### Weapon Rarity 

Weapon rarity is determined at reveal when a lootbox is opened. Rarity impacts a weapon’s base stats, maximum upgrade level, perk availability, and rating potential.

For weapon rarity drop rates, see **Minting & Pricing**.

### **Upgrade Caps by Rarity**

| Rarity   | Max Upgrade Level |
| :------- | :---------------- |
| Common   | Level 4           |
| Uncommon | Level 4           |
| Rare     | Level 5           |
| Epic     | Level 5           |

For upgrade cost scaling, see **Upgrades & Progression**.

### **Weapon Damage Types**

Weapons align with the same elemental damage system used by Genesis characters.

| Damage Type | Ranged Weapons | Melee Weapons        |
| :---------- | :------------- | :------------------- |
| Kinetic     | Shotgun, SMG   | Katana, Chain Sword  |
| Fire        | N/A            | Plasma Cutter, Laser |
| Electric    | Tesla          | Shocker              |
| Toxic       | Acid Launcher  | N/A                  |
| Quantum     | Blaster        | N/A                  |

This alignment allows players to build synergy between Genesis Origins and weapon loadouts.

### **Weapon Perks**

Weapon perks are unlocked **at the moment a Mystery Lootbox is opened**. They are randomly assigned based on weapon rarity and cannot be added later.

Perks only appear on **Uncommon, Rare, and Epic** weapons and scale in strength through multiple levels (I, II, III).

| Weapon Type | Total Perks | Notes                                                |
| :---------- | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Melee       | 10          | Includes mobility, damage over time, control effects |
| Ranged      | 11          | Includes DPS scaling, AoE, ammo and reload modifiers |

<Note>
  Perks are randomly assigned at reveal, making each weapon a unique strategic asset.

### **Weapon Rating and Progression**

Weapons have both a rating and level.

| :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rating    | Composite score based on rarity, base stats, perks, and upgrade level |
| Level     | Upgrade progression from Level 0 to Level 4 or 5 depending on rarity  |

Upgrading a weapon increases its stats and rating, improving combat performance over time.
