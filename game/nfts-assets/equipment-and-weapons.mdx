Weapons are core gameplay assets that directly affect combat performance, build composition, and progression consistency. Weapon NFTs are designed for repeated use, upgrades, and long term optimisation within the defined progression system.

This page defines weapon structure, supply constraints, rarity behavior, and upgrade boundaries.

Lootbox lifecycle and reveal flow are defined in [**Mystery Lootboxes**](/game/nfts-assets/mystery-lootboxes). Pricing and rarity drop rates are defined in [**Minting & Pricing.**](/game/nfts-assets/minting-and-pricing)

### Weapon Categories and Loadout Rules

Weapons are divided into two categories.

- **Melee weapons**\
  Close range combat, burst damage, and utility effects
- **Ranged weapons**\
  Mid to long range combat and sustained damage output

To enter earning eligible PvE gameplay, players must equip **one melee weapon and one ranged weapon**.

<Note>
  Starter weapons are provided for onboarding. Starter weapons are non NFT and non upgradeable. 
</Note>

### **Weapon Supply and Distribution**

Weapon supply is fixed and controlled through lootbox distribution.

| Item                       | Details                            |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Total Lootboxes            | 10,000                             |
| Weapons per Lootbox        | 1                                  |
| Total Weapon Types         | 10                                 |
| Ranged Weapons             | 6                                  |
| Melee Weapons              | 4                                  |
| Max Supply per Weapon Type | 1,000                              |
| Drop Pool Behavior         | Weapon removed once cap is reached |

<Note>
  Once a weapon type reaches its maximum supply, it is permanently removed from the drop pool.
</Note>

### Weapon Rarity

Weapon rarity assignment is determined at reveal through smart contract execution and cannot be modified afterward.

- Base stats
- Upgrade caps
- Perk availability
- Maximum rating potential

### **Upgrade Caps by Rarity**

| Rarity   | Max Upgrade Level |
| :------- | :---------------- |
| Common   | Level 4           |
| Uncommon | Level 4           |
| Rare     | Level 5           |
| Epic     | Level 5           |

For upgrade cost scaling, see **Upgrades & Progression**.

### **Weapon Damage Types**

Weapons align with the same elemental damage system used by Genesis characters.

| Damage Type | Ranged Weapons | Melee Weapons        |
| :---------- | :------------- | :------------------- |
| Kinetic     | Shotgun, SMG   | Katana, Chain Sword  |
| Fire        | N/A            | Plasma Cutter, Laser |
| Electric    | Tesla          | Shocker              |
| Toxic       | Acid Launcher  | N/A                  |
| Quantum     | Blaster        | N/A                  |

This alignment allows players to build synergy between Genesis Origins and weapon loadouts.

### Weapon Stat Categories

Weapons are defined by a structured set of base stats and modifiers that determine combat behavior.

**Base stat categories include:**

- Damage type and damage output
- Critical chance and critical damage
- Fire rate and attack speed
- Range and area of effect, where applicable
- Capacity, ammo, and reload behavior for ranged weapons

**Perks** act as modifiers layered on top of base stats, adding conditional effects and synergies rather than replacing core stat behavior.

Exact stat values, scaling, and calculations are surfaced in the game client.

### **Weapon Perks**

Weapon perks are assigned randomly at the moment of reveal and cannot be added later.

- Perks appear only on Uncommon, Rare, and Epic weapons
- Perks scale by level (I, II, III) based on rarity
- Each weapon’s perk combination is unique

| Melee       | 10          | Includes mobility, damage over time, control effects |

### **Weapon Rating and Progression**

Weapons have both a rating and level.

| Attribute | Description                                                                    |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rating    | Is a composite value derived from rarity, base stats, perks, and upgrade level |
| Level     | Reflects upgrade progression from Level 0 to the rarity defined cap            |

Weapon upgrades increase weapon level and modify stats and rating. Upgrade mechanics, caps, and cost scaling are defined in [**Upgrades & Progression**](/game/nfts-assets/upgrades-and-progression).

> Upgrades do not change reward caps or reward eligibility.
