Mystery Lootboxes are unopened weapon containers managed through the Super Galactic Hub. Each lootbox contains one weapon NFT, but the outcome is determined only when the lootbox is opened.

For lootbox pricing tiers, supported payment options, and rarity drop rates, see [**Minting & Pricing**.](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/nfts-assets/minting-and-pricing)

### **What Is a Mystery Lootbox**

A Mystery Lootbox is an owned Hub asset that represents an unrevealed weapon. Before opening, the contents are not assigned and cannot be inspected.

When opened, the lootbox is consumed and a weapon NFT is revealed and assigned permanently.

### What’s Inside

Each lootbox reveals one random weapon from a fixed pool of 10 weapon types across melee and ranged categories.

When revealed, the weapon NFT is assigned its core properties, including weapon type, rarity, damage type, attributes, and perks where applicable.

For weapon types, damage types, perk rules, and upgrade behavior, see [**Equipment & Weapons**.](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/nfts-assets/equipment-and-weapons)

### Why Players Use Lootboxes

Weapons are core gameplay assets used to build loadouts and progress through upgrades.

To participate in Play to Earn PvE gameplay, players equip one melee weapon and one ranged weapon. Lootboxes provide a direct way to acquire additional weapons beyond starter equipment.

### Trading Lootboxes in the Super Galactic Hub

Before opening, lootboxes remain owned assets in your Hub inventory and can be traded without revealing their contents.

From the Hub, you can:

- List a lootbox for sale at a fixed price
- List a lootbox via auction
- Transfer a lootbox to another wallet
- Open the lootbox at any time

For purchase flows and gifting at purchase, see [**Minting & Pricing**.](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/nfts-assets/minting-and-pricing)

### Opening and Reveal

When a player chooses to open a lootbox:

2. The minting process begins and reveals a weapon NFT
2. All attributes, rarity, and perks are permanently locked

After reveal, the weapon becomes the tradable asset and can be used, upgraded, or traded on the marketplace.

### Hub Inventory vs In-Game Visibility

Unopened lootboxes remain in the Super Galactic Hub. Only revealed weapon NFTs appear in the game client after wallet connection.

When you sign in to Super Galactic and connect the wallet used in the Hub, the game detects and displays:

- Genesis NFTs
- Revealed weapon NFTs

### Activity History

All lootbox actions are recorded in Super Galactic Hub Activity, including purchases, transfers, listings and sales, lootbox openings, and weapon reveals.
