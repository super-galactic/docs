Mystery Lootboxes are the primary distribution method for weapon NFTs in Super Galactic. They are designed to give players flexibility, transparency, and control over how and when they acquire weapons, without forcing immediate gameplay commitments.

Lootboxes are managed through the [Super Galactic Hub](https://app.ufogaming.io/) and integrate seamlessly with Super Galactic gameplay.

### **What Is a Mystery Lootbox**

Each Mystery Lootbox contains **one weapon NFT**, which is only revealed when the lootbox is opened.

Upon opening, the revealed weapon is permanently assigned:

- Weapon type (melee or ranged)
- Rarity
- Damage type
- Base attributes
- Perks, if applicable
- Rating and upgrade level

Once revealed, the lootbox is consumed and replaced by the weapon NFT.

### Pricing and Payment

Lootbox pricing tiers, supported payment options, and network availability are listed in **Minting & Pricing**.

### **Ownership Before Opening**

Once purchased, a Mystery Lootbox is delivered directly to the player’s inventory.

Before opening, players may:

- Hold the lootbox
- List it for sale
- Create fixed price listings
- Auction it
- Gift it to another player

Opening a lootbox is optional. Players are never required to open a lootbox in order to trade or transfer it.

### **Opening and Reveal**

When a player chooses to open a lootbox:

- The minting process begins
- A unique weapon NFT is revealed
- All attributes, rarity, and perks are permanently locked

After reveal, the weapon becomes the tradable asset and can be used, upgraded, or traded on the marketplace.

### **Design Philosophy**

Mystery Lootboxes are designed to:

- Preserve controlled weapon scarcity
- Provide clear expectations before purchase
- Support secondary market activity without inflation
- Avoid forced or predatory mechanics

Players remain in full control over whether to hold, trade, or open a lootbox.
