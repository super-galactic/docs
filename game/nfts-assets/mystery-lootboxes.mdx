Mystery Lootboxes are container assets managed through the [Super Galactic Hub marketplace](https://app.ufogaming.io/). Each lootbox represents an unrevealed weapon NFT. The lootbox itself is an owned asset until it is opened.

This page defines the lootbox lifecycle and reveal boundary only. Weapon behavior and progression rules are defined elsewhere.

### What a Mystery Lootbox Is

A Mystery Lootbox is a Hub asset that represents a weapon that has not yet been revealed.

Before opening:

- The weapon is **not assigned**
- Contents cannot be inspected
- No weapon attributes, rarity, or perks are visible

The lootbox exists independently of the weapon it will later reveal.

### Ownership and Trading Before Opening

While unopened, a Mystery Lootbox remains a standalone asset in the Super Galactic Hub.

Unopened lootboxes can be:

- Listed for sale at a fixed price
- Listed via auction
- Transferred to another wallet
- Gifted at purchase

All ownership actions are recorded in Hub activity history.

### Opening and Reveal

When a player opens a Mystery Lootbox:

- The lootbox is consumed
- A weapon NFT is revealed
- Weapon properties are **assigned at reveal** and permanently locked

Assigned properties include weapon type, rarity, attributes, rating, and perks where applicable. Once revealed, the lootbox no longer exists and the weapon NFT becomes the owned asset.

### Hub Inventory and In Game Visibility

- Unopened lootboxes appear only in the Super Galactic Hub
- Revealed weapon NFTs appear in the game client after wallet connection

The game client detects owned weapon NFTs automatically when the associated wallet is connected.

### Activity Tracking

All lootbox related actions are recorded in Hub activity, including:

- Purchases
- Transfers
- Listings and sales
- Lootbox openings
- Weapon reveals

This ensures full visibility of asset history.
