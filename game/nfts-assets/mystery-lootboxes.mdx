Mystery Lootboxes are the primary distribution method for weapon NFTs in Super Galactic. They are designed to give players flexibility, transparency, and control over how and when they acquire weapons, without forcing immediate gameplay commitments.

Lootboxes are managed through the UFO Gaming Hub and integrate seamlessly with Super Galactic gameplay.

### **What Is a Mystery Lootbox**

Each Mystery Lootbox contains **one weapon NFT**, which is only revealed when the lootbox is opened.

Upon opening, the revealed weapon is permanently assigned:

- Weapon type (melee or ranged)
- Rarity
- Damage type
- Base attributes
- Perks, if applicable
- Rating and upgrade level

Once revealed, the lootbox is consumed and replaced by the weapon NFT.

### **Purchase, Pricing, and Currencies**

Mystery Lootboxes are sold in limited supply and follow a tiered pricing model based on total units sold.

| Supply Sold    | Price per Lootbox |
| :------------- | :---------------- |
| 0 – 3,000      | \$25              |
| 3,001 – 7,000  | \$30              |
| 7,001 – 10,000 | \$35              |

Lootboxes can be purchased through the UFO Gaming Hub using supported currencies and networks, including:

- USDT
- AVAX
- BNB
- BEAM

Pricing updates automatically as supply milestones are reached, rewarding early participation.

### **Ownership Before Opening**

Once purchased, a Mystery Lootbox is delivered directly to the player’s inventory.

Before opening, players may:

- Hold the lootbox
- List it for sale
- Create fixed price listings
- Auction it
- Gift it to another player

Opening a lootbox is optional. Players are never required to open a lootbox in order to trade or transfer it.

### **Rarity Drop Rates**

Weapon rarity is determined at the moment a lootbox is opened. Drop rates are fixed and fully transparent.

| Rarity   | Drop Rate |
| :------- | :-------- |
| Common   | 68%       |
| Uncommon | 30%       |
| Rare     | 1.8%      |
| Epic     | 0.2%      |

Rarity influences a weapon’s base stats, maximum upgrade level, perk availability, and long term progression potential.

### **Opening and Reveal**

When a player chooses to open a lootbox:

- The minting process begins
- A unique weapon NFT is revealed
- All attributes, rarity, and perks are permanently locked

After reveal, the weapon becomes the tradable asset and can be used, upgraded, or traded on the marketplace.

### **Design Philosophy**

Mystery Lootboxes are designed to:

- Preserve controlled weapon scarcity
- Provide clear expectations before purchase
- Support secondary market activity without inflation
- Avoid forced or predatory mechanics

Players remain in full control over whether to hold, trade, or open a lootbox.
