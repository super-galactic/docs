The Originals represent the foundation of Super Galactic.

Genesis Origin UFOeps are Super Galactic’s original playable NFTs. They combine fixed scarcity with direct in-game utility, functioning as both characters and long-term progression assets. Each Genesis is unique at the trait level and evolves through upgrades and system participation.

### Scarcity and Supply

Genesis Origin UFOeps are the foundation of the Super Galactic asset ecosystem. Supply is fixed at 10,000 Genesis Origin NFTs, distributed across **10 Origins** with **1,000 per Origin**. Once minted, no additional Genesis Origin UFOeps can ever be created.

Each Genesis is generated with a unique composition at mint. While two Genesis may share an Origin identity, their underlying body part mix, rarity distribution, and attributes differ, which is what makes each one distinct as a playable asset.

### What Genesis Origin Unlocks

Owning at least one Genesis Origin UFOep unlocks access to Super Galactic’s Play to Earn PvE reward path. Genesis are the primary ownership gate for earning UAP through eligible PvE missions.

For reward eligibility by mode and the earning rules, see [**Rewards System.**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/rewards-system)

### Built for Gameplay

Genesis Origin UFOeps are fully playable 3D characters used directly in Super Galactic gameplay. They are designed to function as active game assets, with combat identity and performance shaped by their underlying composition rather than being static collectibles.

Genesis are usable across core gameplay experiences, with Demo Mode allowing players to test characters and builds.

### Body Part Composition

Each Genesis Origin UFOep is composed of **six body parts**, and each part contributes to the character’s overall identity and progression potential:

- Head
- Arms
- Chest
- Backpack
- Legs
- Ears

Body parts vary by rarity and attribute weighting. Together, they influence visual identity, base stats, and maximum progression potential over time.

### Origins, Damage Types, and Combat Identity

Genesis Origin NFTs are built around five elemental damage types, but shared elements do not mean identical playstyles. Every Origin expresses its damage type through distinct abilities, role focus, and synergy traits, creating meaningful variation in combat and role composition.

Elemental damage types add strategic depth to Genesis roster building. While multiple Origins may share the same damage type, their combat role, playstyle, and ability design remain distinct. When combined through breeding, these differences create new hybrid possibilities and layered combat tactics.

### Damage Types Overview

| Genesis Name | Shared Type | Unique Design                                                          |
| :----------- | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lumina       | Electric    | Focuses on chain damage, shield restoration, and support               |
| Zutori       | Electric    | Focuses on overclocking, energy regeneration, and high mobility burst  |
| Veilinos     | Toxic       | Focuses on vision denial, zone blinding, and poison over time          |
| Vivius       | Toxic       | Specializes in damage layering, movement debuffs, and bullet splitting |
| Myronox      | Kinetic     | Emphasizes team buffs, frontline power, and utility grenades           |
| Valan        | Kinetic     | Built for bruiser DPS, self sustain, and finishing pressure            |
| Voxis        | Quantum     | Focused on distraction, crowd blinding, and movement based AoE         |
| Zegoc        | Quantum     | Delivers focused laser damage, blind stacking, and slow zones          |
| Incendius    | Fire        | Uses shield fed burn damage, napalm, and rapid strikes                 |
| Speytri      | Fire        | Built for mobility critical pressure, area ignition, and ally synergy  |

<Note>
  Origins that share the same elemental damage type are intentionally designed to feel different in combat. Ability design, role focus, and stat scaling ensure no Origin is interchangeable.

### Genesis Class Table

### Rarity, Uniqueness, and Purebreds

Genesis body parts are minted with randomised rarity levels, creating variation at the part level even within the same Genesis class. Rarity is rolled independently per body part, so a single Genesis can contain a mix of rarities across its six parts. A Purebred Genesis is one where all six body parts originate from the same Origin, and remains one of the rarest outcomes with strong visual identity and collectible value. While two Genesis can share a similar visual base or rarity pattern, each unit is defined by its randomised stats and rating profile, creating a unique footprint within the ecosystem.

For rarity tiers, and mint drop rates, see **Minting & Pricing**. For how rarity affects upgrade caps and rating potential, see **Rarity, Attributes & Rating**.

### Progression and Visual Evolution

Genesis characters grow stronger over time. Body parts can be upgraded using UAP, increasing stats, rating, and visual detail. Higher rarity parts unlock higher upgrade caps, allowing deeper progression and more powerful builds.

As Genesis evolve, they visually reflect their progression, reinforcing the connection between gameplay, ownership, and identity.

For upgrade mechanics, upgrade caps, and cost scaling, see **Upgrades & Progression**.
