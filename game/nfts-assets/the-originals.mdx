The Originals represent the foundation of Super Galactic.

Genesis Origin UFOeps are the first generation of fully playable characters, designed to anchor the game’s progression, economy, and long term player ecosystem. They are not static collectibles. Each Genesis is a living asset that evolves through gameplay, upgrades, and strategic investment.

Only **10,000 Genesis Origin UFOeps** exist. This supply is fixed and immutable. No new Genesis Origin will ever be created.

### **Scarcity by Design**

Genesis NFTs are intentionally scarce. They are divided across **10 distinct Origins**, with **1,000 Genesis per Origin**. Each Origin aligns with a specific damage type and combat identity, creating natural diversity in playstyles and builds.

Genesis are the only assets required to unlock Play to Earn gameplay. One Genesis is enough to onboard, progress, and earn UAP. This ensures accessibility while preserving the long term value of Genesis ownership.

### **Built for Gameplay**

Every Genesis is fully playable in Super Galactic. Characters are rendered in 3D, animated, and designed for fast paced combat. They are used directly in PvE missions and future competitive modes.

Each Genesis is composed of **six core body parts**:

- Head
- Arms
- Chest
- Backpack
- Legs
- Ears

Each body part has its own rarity and Origin alignment. Together, they define the character’s stats, rating, visual identity, and upgrade potential.

### **Rarity, Identity, and Purebreds**

Genesis body parts are minted with randomized rarity levels:

- Common
- Uncommon
- Rare
- Epic

A **Purebred Genesis** is one where all six body parts originate from the same Origin. Purebreds are among the rarest outcomes and carry strong visual identity and collectible value.

No two Genesis are identical. Variations in body parts, rarity, stats, and rating ensure each character has a unique footprint within the ecosystem.

### **Progression and Evolution**

Genesis characters grow stronger over time. Body parts can be upgraded using UAP, increasing stats, rating, and visual detail. Higher rarity parts unlock higher upgrade caps, allowing deeper progression and more powerful builds.

As Genesis evolve, they visually reflect their progression, reinforcing the connection between gameplay, ownership, and identity.

Genesis are not designed to be flipped and forgotten. They are designed to be played, improved, and mastered.

### **The Role of Genesis in the Ecosystem**

Genesis Origin UFOeps sit at the center of Super Galactic:

- Required for Play to Earn
- Core driver of progression
- Foundation of future breeding systems
- Anchor of long term scarcity

They represent commitment, identity, and participation in the game’s evolution.

For players, Genesis are the gateway to progression.\
For collectors, they are the first and rarest generation.\
For the ecosystem, they are the cornerstone.
