The Originals represent the foundation of Super Galactic.

Genesis Origin UFOeps are the first generation of fully playable characters, designed to anchor the game’s progression, economy, and long term player ecosystem. They are not static collectibles. Each Genesis is a living asset that evolves through gameplay, upgrades, and strategic investment.

Only **10,000 Genesis Origin UFOeps** exist. This supply is fixed and immutable. No new Genesis Origin will ever be created.

### **Scarcity by Design**

Genesis NFTs are intentionally scarce. They are divided across **10 distinct Origins**, with **1,000 Genesis per Origin**. Each Origin aligns with a specific damage type and combat identity, creating natural diversity in playstyles and builds.

Genesis are the only assets required to unlock Play to Earn gameplay. One Genesis is enough to onboard, progress, and earn UAP. This ensures accessibility while preserving the long term value of Genesis ownership.

### **Built for Gameplay**

Every Genesis is fully playable in Super Galactic. Characters are rendered in 3D, animated, and designed for fast paced combat. They are used directly in PvE missions and future competitive modes.

Each Genesis is composed of **six core body parts**:

- Head
- Arms
- Chest
- Backpack
- Legs
- Ears

Each body part has its own rarity and Origin alignment. Together, they define the character’s stats, rating, visual identity, and upgrade potential.

### **Genesis Damage Types & Combat Identity**

Each Genesis Origin NFT shares one of five elemental damage types, but no two use them the same way. Each Origin expresses its damage style through unique abilities, role focus, and synergy traits.

| Origin    | Shared Type | Unique Design                                                          |
| :-------- | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lumina    | Electric    | Focuses on chain damage, shield restoration, and support               |
| Zutori    | Electric    | Focuses on overclocking, energy regeneration, and high mobility burst  |
| Veilinos  | Toxic       | Focuses on vision denial, zone blinding, and poison over time          |
| Vivius    | Toxic       | Specializes in damage layering, movement debuffs, and bullet splitting |
| Myronox   | Kinetic     | Emphasizes team buffs, frontline power, and utility grenades           |
| Valan     | Kinetic     | Built for bruiser DPS, self sustain, and finishing pressure            |
| Voxis     | Quantum     | Focused on distraction, crowd blinding, and movement based AoE         |
| Zegoc     | Quantum     | Delivers focused laser damage, blind stacking, and slow zones          |
| Incendius | Fire        | Uses shield fed burn damage, napalm, and rapid strikes                 |
| Speytri   | Fire        | Built for mobility critical pressure, area ignition, and ally synergy  |

These elemental differences bring strategic depth to squad building. When combined through breeding, they unlock hybrid builds and layered combat tactics.

**Genesis class table**

Each Genesis Origin UFOep belongs to a distinct combat identity defined by its elemental damage type and role focus. These identities shape playstyle, squad synergy, and strategic depth across PvE and future competitive modes.

| Genesis Name | Damage Type | Combat Role                     | Supply |
| :----------- | :---------- | :------------------------------ | :----- |
| Lumina       | Electric    | Support DPS, energy shield      | 1,000  |
| Zutori       | Electric    | Burst DPS, energy cycling       | 1,000  |
| Veilinos     | Toxic       | AoE debuffer, zone denial       | 1,000  |
| Vivius       | Toxic       | Zone control, sustained debuffs | 1,000  |
| Myronox      | Kinetic     | Melee tank, team protector      | 1,000  |
| Valan        | Kinetic     | Bruiser tank, disruptor         | 1,000  |
| Voxis        | Quantum     | Vision control, flash burst     | 1,000  |
| Zegoc        | Quantum     | Laser DPS, blind stacking       | 1,000  |
| Incendius    | Fire        | AoE damage, high aggression     | 1,000  |
| Speytri      | Fire        | Speed DPS, critical strikes     | 1,000  |

Each Genesis is part of a limited edition group of 1,000 and can breed up to 7 times to produce Alpha or Beta offspring. Breeding combinations influence visuals, abilities, and part origins.

### **Rarity, Identity, and Purebreds**

Genesis body parts are minted with randomized rarity levels:

- Common
- Uncommon
- Rare
- Epic

A **Purebred Genesis** is one where all six body parts originate from the same Origin. Purebreds are among the rarest outcomes and carry strong visual identity and collectible value.

No two Genesis are identical. Variations in body parts, rarity, stats, and rating ensure each character has a unique footprint within the ecosystem.

### **Progression and Evolution**

Genesis characters grow stronger over time. Body parts can be upgraded using UAP, increasing stats, rating, and visual detail. Higher rarity parts unlock higher upgrade caps, allowing deeper progression and more powerful builds.

As Genesis evolve, they visually reflect their progression, reinforcing the connection between gameplay, ownership, and identity.

Genesis are not designed to be flipped and forgotten. They are designed to be played, improved, and mastered.

### **The Role of Genesis in the Ecosystem**

Genesis Origin UFOeps sit at the center of Super Galactic:

- Required for Play to Earn
- Core driver of progression
- Foundation of future breeding systems
- Anchor of long term scarcity

They represent commitment, identity, and participation in the game’s evolution.

For players, Genesis are the gateway to progression.\
For collectors, they are the first and rarest generation.\
For the ecosystem, they are the cornerstone.
