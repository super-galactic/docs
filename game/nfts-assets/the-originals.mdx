The Originals are the foundation of Super Galactic’s playable NFT ecosystem.

**Genesis Origin UFOeps** are the original playable character NFTs. They combine fixed scarcity with direct in game utility, functioning as both characters and long term progression assets. Each Genesis is unique at the trait level and evolves through upgrades and system participation.

### Scarcity and Supply

Genesis Origin UFOeps have a fixed supply of **10,000**.

- 10 Origins
- 1,000 per Origin
- Once minted, no additional Genesis Origin UFOeps can be created

Each Genesis is generated with a unique composition at mint. While two Genesis may share the same Origin identity, their body part mix, rarity distribution, and attributes differ.

### What Genesis Origin Unlocks

Owning at least one Genesis Origin UFOep unlocks **access to earning eligible PvE gameplay**. Genesis are the ownership gate for Play to Earn PvE participation. 

Reward generation, limits, and claim behavior are defined in Economy → [Rewards System.](/game/economy/rewards-system)

### Built for Gameplay

Genesis Origin UFOeps are fully playable 3D characters used directly in Super Galactic gameplay. They are not static collectibles. Combat identity and performance are shaped by composition, rarity, and upgrades.

Genesis can be used across gameplay modes. Progression and upgrades are available only in ownership enabled modes.

### Body Part Composition

Each Genesis Origin UFOep is composed of six body parts. Each part contributes to visual identity, base stats, and progression potential.

1. Head
2. Arms
3. Chest
4. Backpack
5. Legs
6. Ears

Body parts vary by rarity and attribute weighting. Higher rarity parts unlock deeper upgrade caps and higher maximum rating potential.

For how rarity, attributes, and upgrade levels combine into rating, see Rarity, Attributes & Rating.

### Origins, Damage Types, and Combat Identity

Genesis Origin NFTs align to five elemental damage types. Origins that share the same damage type are intentionally designed to feel different in combat. Shared elements do not imply interchangeable roles.

Elemental damage types add strategic depth to roster building. Origin identity, ability design, and role focus create distinct combat profiles

**Damage Types Overview**

| Genesis Name | Shared Type | Unique Design                                                          |

### Uniqueness and Purebreds

Each Genesis Origin UFOep is unique at the trait, body part, and attribute level.

A **Purebred** Genesis is a Genesis where all six body parts originate from the same Origin. Purebreds are rare outcomes and are defined by composition, not by upgrade level.

For rarity tiers and how rarity affects upgrade caps and rating potential, see [Rarity, Attributes & Rating](/game/nfts-assets/rarity-attributes-rating)

### Progression and Visual Evolution

Genesis progression is component based. Upgrades apply to individual body parts, and visual evolution occurs at the body part level. When a part is upgraded, that component updates visually on the 3D character model, even if other parts remain at lower levels.

For upgrade mechanics, upgrade caps, and cost scaling, see [Upgrades & Progression](/game/nfts-assets/upgrades-and-progression).

Genesis mint pricing, supply progression, and rarity drop rates are documented in [**Minting & Pricing.**](/game/nfts-assets/minting-and-pricing)
