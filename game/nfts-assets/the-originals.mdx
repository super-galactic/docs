The Originals are the foundation of Super Galactic’s playable NFT ecosystem.

**Genesis Origin UFOeps** are the original playable character NFTs. They combine fixed scarcity with direct in game utility, functioning as both characters and long term progression assets. Each Genesis is unique at the trait level and evolves through upgrades.

### Scarcity and Supply

Genesis Origin UFOeps have a fixed supply of **10,000**.

- 10 Origins
- 1,000 per Origin
- Once minted, no additional Genesis Origin UFOeps can be created

Each Genesis is generated with a unique composition at mint. While two Genesis may share the same Origin identity, their body part mix, rarity distribution, and attributes differ.

### What Genesis Origin Unlocks

Owning at least one Genesis Origin UFOep unlocks **access to earning eligible PvE gameplay**. Genesis are the ownership gate for Play to Earn PvE participation.

Reward generation, limits, and claim behavior are defined in Economy → [Rewards System.](/game/economy/rewards-system)

### Built for Gameplay

Genesis Origin UFOeps are fully playable 3D characters used directly in Super Galactic gameplay. Combat identity and performance are shaped by composition, rarity, and upgrades.

Genesis can be used across gameplay modes. Progression and upgrades are available only in ownership enabled modes.

### Body Part Composition

Genesis Origin UFOep is composed of **six body parts**.

Each body part is assigned its own rarity at mint. A single Genesis can contain a mix of rarities across its components, with each body part contributing independently to the overall character profile.

The example below illustrates a Genesis minted with mixed body part rarities, along with per part rating contribution and initial upgrade level.

| Body Part | Rarity                                | Rating  | Level |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ------- | ----- |
| Head      | <Badge color="Purple">Epic</Badge> | 26      | 0/5   |
| Arms      | <Badge color="green">Uncommon</Badge> | 18      | 0/5   |
| Backpack  | <Badge color="green">Uncommon</Badge> | 32      | 0/5   |
| Chest     | <Badge color="white">Common</Badge>   | 15      | 0/5   |
| Legs      | <Badge color="white">Common</Badge>   | 14      | 0/5   |
| Ears      | <Badge color="blue">Rare</Badge>      | 25      | 0/5   |
| **Total** | —                                     | **130** | —     |

Rarity assignment and drop rates are defined in [**Minting & Pricing**](/game/nfts-assets/minting-and-pricing).

### Attributes and Rating

Each Genesis Origin UFOep is defined by the combined attributes and ratings of its six body parts.

**Attributes** are derived from body part composition and rarity. They determine how a Genesis performs in gameplay, including survivability, damage output, and ability effectiveness. Attribute values are visible in the game client.

**Rating** is a composite value calculated from the ratings of all six body parts.

- Each body part contributes its own rating value
- Higher rarity body parts contribute higher rating values
- Total Genesis rating is the sum of individual body part ratings

Rating provides a consistent way to compare Genesis progression depth and build strength.

### Origins, Damage Types, and Combat Identity

Genesis Origin NFTs align to five elemental damage types. Origins that share the same damage type are intentionally designed to feel different in combat. Shared elements do not imply interchangeable roles.

Elemental damage types add strategic depth to roster building. Origin identity, ability design, and role focus create distinct combat profiles.

**Damage Types Overview**

| Genesis Name | Shared Type | Unique Design                                                          |
| :----------- | :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lumina       | Electric    | Focuses on chain damage, shield restoration, and support               |
| Zutori       | Electric    | Focuses on overclocking, energy regeneration, and high mobility burst  |

### Uniqueness and Purebreds

Each Genesis Origin UFOep is unique at the trait, body part, and attribute level.

A **Purebred** Genesis is a Genesis where all six body parts originate from the same Origin. Purebreds are rare outcomes and are defined by composition, not by upgrade level.

### Progression and Visual Evolution

Genesis progression is component based. Upgrades apply to individual body parts, and visual evolution occurs at the body part level. When a part is upgraded, that component updates visually on the 3D character model, even if other parts remain at lower levels.

For upgrade mechanics, upgrade caps, and cost scaling, see [Upgrades & Progression](/game/nfts-assets/upgrades-and-progression).

Genesis mint pricing, supply progression, and rarity drop rates are documented in [**Minting & Pricing.**](/game/nfts-assets/minting-and-pricing)
