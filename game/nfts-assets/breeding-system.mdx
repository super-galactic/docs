The Breeding System is a core long term progression mechanic in Super Galactic. It allows players to expand their roster, experiment with hybrid builds, and unlock deeper strategic and visual customisation, while preserving strict supply control and economic balance.

Breeding is designed to reward commitment, planning, and ownership rather than short term farming. The system will be accessible through the UFO Gaming Hub and will go live shortly after the UAP token launch.

### **Breeding Overview**

Breeding enables Genesis Origin UFOeps to produce new playable NFTs through controlled generational expansion. These offspring inherit traits from their parents, creating unique combinations of visuals, stats, and combat identity.

Key principles:

- No new Genesis Origin NFTs can ever be created
- All offspring derive from existing Genesis supply
- Each Genesis has a limited number of breeding attempts
- Visual evolution is a core part of the experience

### **Eligible NFT Classes**

Super Galactic NFTs are divided into three playable generations:

| Class                 | Description                                                 |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Genesis Origin UFOeps | First generation, fixed supply, foundation of the ecosystem |
| Alpha UFOeps          | First offspring generation                                  |
| Beta UFOeps           | Second offspring generation                                 |

Genesis Origin UFOeps cannot be bred to create additional Genesis NFTs. All breeding results in Alpha or Beta NFTs only.

### **Breeding Outcome Rules**

The generation of the offspring depends on the parent combination.

| Parent A       | Parent B       | Offspring Result |
| :------------- | :------------- | :--------------- |
| Genesis Origin | Genesis Origin | Alpha            |
| Genesis Origin | Alpha          | Alpha            |
| Genesis Origin | Beta           | Beta             |
| Alpha          | Alpha          | Beta             |
| Alpha          | Beta           | Beta             |
| Beta           | Beta           | Beta             |

This structure ensures a clear generational flow while maintaining scarcity and long term balance.

### **Breeding Limits and Costs**

- Each Genesis Origin UFOep can be bred up to **7 times**
- Breeding costs increase with each attempt
- Breeding requires **UAP only**

Cost scaling is designed to:

- Reward early strategic breeding
- Prevent excessive supply expansion
- Create a meaningful long term UAP sink

### **Breeding Burn Mechanics**

All breeding follows the same in-game economic structure defined in the Game Economy.

- **50% of UAP spent is permanently burned**
- **50% of UAP is allocated to the Reserve Wallet**

### **Genetic Inheritance**

Offspring inherit traits from both parents, including:

- Body parts and Origin identity
- Visual components
- Base stats and rating influence
- Damage type tendencies

A child may inherit mixed body parts from different Origins, creating hybrid visuals and unique combat identities. Pure builds remain scarce and collectible, while mixed builds unlock new strategic paths.

### **Visual Progression and Upgrades**

Breeding is tightly connected to visual progression.

- Offspring NFTs evolve visually as they are upgraded
- Body parts visibly change with progression
- Visual identity reflects Origin mix, rarity, and level

This feature is already implemented at the engine level and will unlock after the UAP launch, giving players a clear long term progression goal.

### **Designed for Sustainability**

The Breeding System is intentionally conservative.

- Supply growth is capped and predictable
- Economic sinks scale with progression
- Visual and gameplay depth increases without infinite inflation

Breeding is optional, but it rewards players who commit to long term ownership and strategy.
