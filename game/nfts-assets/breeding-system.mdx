The Breeding System is a core NFT progression feature in Super Galactic. It enables roster expansion through controlled generational breeding and inherited variation across playable characters.

Breeding is executed through the [**Super Galactic Hub**](https://app.ufogaming.io/) and produces Alpha and Beta offspring only.

### **Breeding Overview**

Breeding allows eligible parent NFTs to produce a new playable UFOep with inherited traits. Offspring inherit a combination of identity and gameplay characteristics from both parents, creating variation across visuals, composition, and combat profile.

Key principles:

- Genesis Origin supply is fixed, and no new Genesis Origin NFTs can be created
- Offspring derive from existing Genesis Origin supply
- Each Genesis Origin has a limited number of breeding attempts
- Offspring are Alpha or Beta only

This system helps owners expand their playable roster and evolve their collection through predictable class rules and controlled limits.

### **Eligible NFT Classes**

Super Galactic playable UFOeps are grouped into three NFT classes. These classes define generation, scarcity, and what a character can produce through breeding.

| Class                 | Description                                                 |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Genesis Origin UFOeps | First generation, fixed supply, foundation of the ecosystem |
| Alpha UFOeps          | First offspring generation created through breeding         |
| Beta UFOeps           | SSecond offspring generation created through breeding       |

Genesis Origin UFOeps cannot be bred to create additional Genesis Origin NFTs. Breeding produces Alpha or Beta offspring only.

### **Breeding Outcome Rules**

Offspring class is determined by the parent pairing. This makes outcomes predictable at the class level while inheritance controls variation at the trait level.

| Parent A       | Parent B       | Offspring Result |
| :------------- | :------------- | :--------------- |
| Genesis Origin | Genesis Origin | Alpha            |
| Genesis Origin | Alpha          | Alpha            |
| Genesis Origin | Beta           | Beta             |
| Alpha          | Alpha          | Beta             |
| Alpha          | Beta           | Beta             |
| Beta           | Beta           | Beta             |

These rules enforce a clear generational flow and prevent uncontrolled creation of first generation supply.

### **Breeding Limits and Costs**

Breeding is intentionally capped and cost-scaled to preserve long-term balance and scarcity.

- Each playable UFOep NFT can be bred up to **7 times**
- Breeding costs increase with each attempt
- Breeding requires **UAP only**

This cap applies to **Genesis Origin, Alpha, and Beta** NFTs. Cost scaling is designed to make early attempts accessible while ensuring repeated breeding remains a meaningful commitment.

### Genetic Inheritance

Offspring inherit traits from both parents, creating variation across builds and identity.

Inheritance can include:

- Body part composition and Origin identity
- Visual components and overall look
- Base attributes and rating influence
- Damage type tendencies

Each breeding outcome is unique at the trait level. While offspring follow the same class rules, the inherited combination of body parts, rarity distribution, and attributes varies based on the parents, resulting in distinct characters over time.

### How Breeding Works in the Super Galactic Hub

Breeding is executed through the Super Galactic Hub using a guided flow:

1. Open the Breeding section in your Hub account
2. Select the first eligible parent NFT
3. Select the second eligible parent NFT
4. The system validates eligibility and confirms the expected offspring class based on pairing rules
5. Confirm the UAP cost and execute the transaction
6. The new NFT is created and added to your owned assets as an Alpha or Beta

A full interface walkthrough is documented under the Super Galactic Hub section.

### **Visual Progression and Upgrades**

Breeding outcomes are driven by inherited composition. When two parent NFTs are bred, the offspring’s body parts and traits are generated through a randomised inheritance process that draws from both parents. The result is unpredictable at the part level, which is what creates variation across hybrid builds and visual identity.

After creation, offspring NFTs continue to evolve visually through upgrades. As characters are upgraded, body parts visibly progress and the overall look becomes more distinct over time, reflecting their inherited composition, rarity distribution, and progression level.

### Economic Integration

Breeding consumes UAP and follows the burn and Game Treasury split defined in Burn Mechanisms. This page does not restate burn execution logic.

For the economic role and reinvestment loop of breeding, see [Breeding Economics](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/breeding-economics)

<Note>
  Breeding will be enabled once all Genesis Origin UFOeps are fully minted. Alpha and Beta characters are available in Demo Mode so players can experience their gameplay and build variation. Demo Mode does not generate UAP rewards.
