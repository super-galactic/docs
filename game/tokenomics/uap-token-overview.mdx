### Where UAP Is Used

UAP is used in two environments:

- **Game Client:** gameplay actions that generate progression outcomes and require UAP enabled systems
- **Super Galactic Hub:** claiming rewards, managing assets, and executing UAP-based transactions

### UAP Utility Across Systems

UAP is used across most progression, asset evolution, and upgrade actions, including:

- Upgrading Genesis body parts and weapons
- Breeding related actions and progression sinks
- Other UAP mediated progression systems documented in Game Economy

For how UAP loops through rewards, sinks, and supply control, see **Game Economy**.

### Earning and Claiming UAP

UAP is earned through eligible gameplay and claimed through the Super Galactic Hub.

For eligibility rules, mission limits, and cooldown mechanics, see **Game Economy → Rewards System**.

### Spending and Supply Control

UAP spent across gameplay systems follows the automated burn and Game Treasury split.

For the burn split and Game Treasury behaviour, see **Game Economy → Burn Mechanisms**.

### Relationship to Tokenomics

UAP’s broader supply model, launch structure, and allocation are documented in Tokenomics.

For full supply and allocation details, see **Tokenomics → Supply & Allocation**.
