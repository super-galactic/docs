### Where UAP Is Used

UAP is used in two environments:

1. **Game Client:** upgrading and progressing NFTs, including Genesis upgrades and weapon upgrades
2. **Super Galactic Hub**: claiming rewards, managing assets, breeding actions, and marketplace activity, including listing NFTs, placing bids, and purchasing listed items

Gameplay usage drives progression. Hub usage handles claiming, asset management, and marketplace execution.

For how UAP loops through rewards, sinks, and supply control, see **Game Economy**.

### Earning and Claiming UAP

UAP is earned through eligible gameplay and claimed through the Super Galactic Hub.

For eligibility rules, mission limits, and cooldown mechanics, see **Game Economy → Rewards System**.

### Spending and Supply Control

UAP spent across gameplay systems follows the automated burn and Game Treasury split.

For the burn split and Game Treasury behaviour, see **Game Economy → Burn Mechanisms**.

### Relationship to Tokenomics

UAP’s broader supply model, launch structure, and allocation are documented in Tokenomics.
