UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) is the native utility token of Super Galactic.

It functions as the primary economic medium that connects gameplay activity, progression systems, and on-chain settlement. UAP is not a governance token and does not represent ownership, voting rights, or revenue participation.

UAP is deployed on the BNB Chain as the primary network for trading and liquidity.

### Where UAP Is Used

UAP is used in two environments:

1. **Game Client:** upgrading and progressing NFTs, including Genesis upgrades and weapon upgrades
2. **Super Galactic Hub:** claiming rewards, managing assets, breeding actions, and marketplace activity settled in UAP, including listing NFTs, placing bids, and purchasing listed items

Gameplay usage drives progression. Hub usage supports claiming, asset management, and marketplace execution.

### Primary Function

UAP exists to support gameplay-driven economic activity.

Within the game, UAP is used to:

- Claim gameplay rewards
- Access progression systems
- Pay upgrade and advancement costs
- Interact with defined gameplay sinks

UAP only enters player circulation through active gameplay participation. Gameplay does not mint new tokens. All UAP distributed through rewards already exists within the fixed total supply.

### Circulation Scope

UAP operates across two distinct domains:

**Player circulation**\
UAP is held in player wallets and used directly within gameplay systems.

**On-chain market activity**\
UAP traded on decentralized exchanges or transferred between wallets.

Gameplay systems interact only with player-circulating UAP. Market trading does not generate rewards, progression, or gameplay advantages.

Game Treasury-held supply is outside player circulation and is created through the spend routing defined in [Burn and Game Treasury Split](/game/economy/burn-mechanisms#burn-and-game-treasury-split). 

For circulation definitions, see [Circulating Supply Dynamics](/game/economy/economy-overview#circulating-supply-dynamics).

### What UAP Is Not Used For

To avoid ambiguity, UAP is explicitly not used for:

- Passive yield or staking rewards
- Inflationary emissions tied to time or participation

All economic utility is tied to gameplay interaction and player-driven decisions.

### Relationship to NFTs and Assets

UAP acts as the settlement token for certain in-game asset interactions but does not represent ownership of NFTs or game assets.

NFT ownership, asset rarity, and marketplace mechanics are defined separately in **NFTs & Assets**. UAP facilitates transactions where applicable but does not alter asset scarcity or ownership rules.

### Supply Discipline

UAP has a fixed, capped total supply.

[Supply & Allocation](/game/tokenomics/supply-and-allocation) pages define how supply is allocated, distributed, and introduced into circulation. Gameplay activity determines circulation levels, not total supply expansion.

### Earning and Claiming UAP

UAP is earned through eligible gameplay and claimed through the Super Galactic Hub.

For eligibility rules, mission limits, and cooldown mechanics, see [Reward Extraction Limits](/game/economy/rewards-system#reward-extraction-limits).

### Spending and Supply Control

UAP spent across gameplay systems follows the automated burn and Game Treasury split.

For burn execution and routing, see [Burn and Game Treasury Split](/game/economy/burn-mechanisms#burn-and-game-treasury-split).

### Relationship to Tokenomics

UAP’s broader supply model, launch structure, and allocation are documented in Tokenomics.
