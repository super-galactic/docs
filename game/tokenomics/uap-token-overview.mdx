UAP is the core utility token powering the Super Galactic ecosystem.

It functions as the primary medium of value across gameplay systems, progression mechanics, and the Super Galactic Hub. UAP is not an abstract reward token. It is an active utility asset designed to connect gameplay, ownership, and long-term progression within a single integrated ecosystem.

> UAP is fully integrated across the game client and the Super Galactic Hub, enabling seamless earning, claiming, spending, and asset progression across systems.

---

## Role of UAP in the Ecosystem

UAP serves three primary roles:

- Enables gameplay progression and upgrades
- Powers asset creation and evolution systems
- Acts as the connective layer between the game client and the Super Galactic Hub

Every meaningful interaction involving progression, customization, or advancement is mediated through UAP.

---

## UAP Utility Across Systems

UAP is fully integrated across both core Super Galactic environments:

- **The Game Client (Unity)**
- **The Super Galactic Hub**

These systems are designed to operate as a single synchronized experience.

---

### In-Game Utility

Within the game client, UAP is used to:

- Upgrade characters and weapons
- Progress through long-term advancement systems
- Trigger automated burn and treasury mechanics through spending

All in-game UAP usage is tied directly to active gameplay and progression.

---

### Super Galactic Hub Utility

The Super Galactic Hub is the unified application layer for asset management, progression visibility, and ownership actions.

Within the Hub, players can:

- View UAP balances
- Claim earned UAP
- Breed NFTs using UAP
- Manage and interact with owned NFTs
- View real-time updates to NFT stats, progression, and evolution

The Hub is not just a marketplace. It is the primary interface that connects gameplay activity with on-chain asset ownership.

---

## Cross-System Synchronization

Super Galactic is designed as a fully synchronized ecosystem. Gameplay actions and asset management operate as a single cohesive experience across the game client and the Super Galactic Hub, ensuring consistency across progression, inventory, and ownership.

> Detailed synchronization flows and system architecture are documented under [**Ecosystem Architecture.**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/overview/ecosystem-architecture)

## Earning and Claiming UAP

UAP is earned exclusively through gameplay activity.

- Rewards are generated in-game through mission completion
- Earned UAP can be claimed through the Super Galactic Hub
- Claimed UAP is immediately usable across all supported systems

Detailed reward mechanics are documented under **Game Economy → Rewards System**.

---

## Spending and Supply Control

All UAP spending across gameplay systems follows the same economic rules:

- Spending triggers automated burn mechanisms
- Remaining portions flow to the game treasury
- Supply reduction scales with player activity

Detailed burn logic is documented under **Game Economy → Burn Mechanisms**.

---

## Design Principles

UAP is designed around the following principles:

- Utility first, speculation second
- Usage driven by gameplay, not emissions
- Full transparency across systems
- Seamless integration between game and Hub

This ensures that UAP remains functional, sustainable, and tightly coupled to player engagement.
