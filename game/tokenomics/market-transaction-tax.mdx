UAP includes a market level transaction tax that applies to **secondary market trading only**.

This mechanism is completely separate from in game spending, progression systems, and gameplay related burn mechanics.

## Scope of the Transaction Tax

The market transaction tax applies exclusively to **sell transactions** involving UAP.

- **0% tax on buys**
- **10% tax on sells**

This design applies no tax on acquisition while enforcing a defined rule on sell side transactions.

---

## Sell Tax Overview

When UAP is sold on supported markets:

- A **10% sell tax** is applied
- The tax is enforced at the smart contract level
- The mechanism is transparent and verifiable on chain

<Note>
  The sell tax does not apply to in game usage, upgrades, breeding, or progression related actions.

## Purpose of the Market Transaction Tax

The market transaction tax exists to provide **economic flexibility and long term stability**.

Sell tax proceeds may be used, when required, to:

- Support overall ecosystem balance
- Reinforce supply control through discretionary burns
- Enable community aligned initiatives

The 10% sell tax rate is fixed. The allocation or use of collected sell tax proceeds may vary based on ecosystem needs, such as discretionary burns or community aligned initiatives.

## Separation from Gameplay Mechanics

Market transaction taxes operate independently from in game economic systems.

- Gameplay spending follows automated burn and treasury mechanisms
- Rewards and progression are governed by the Game Economy
- Market taxes apply only to external trading activity

This separation ensures clarity between **trading behavior** and **gameplay progression**.

Detailed gameplay burn logic is documented under \*\*Game Economy → \*\*[**Burn Mechanisms**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/burn-mechanisms).

## Transparency and Enforcement

The market transaction tax:

- Is enforced automatically by smart contracts
- Cannot be bypassed on sell transactions
- Is publicly visible and auditable on chain

Any adjustments to sell tax usage or parameters, if ever required, would be communicated transparently.

## Design Principles

The market transaction tax follows these principles:

- No friction on entry
- Predictable exit rules
- Clear separation from gameplay economics
- Flexibility without inflation

This ensures market rules remain understandable while preserving long term ecosystem health.

  This section describes market level transaction taxes only.\
  In game burn mechanisms, reward systems, and progression sinks are documented separately under **Game Economy**.
