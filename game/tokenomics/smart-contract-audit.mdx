Super Galactic smart contracts (Solidity) have undergone independent third party security review by **CertiK**, covering the on-chain systems used by UAP, Super Galactic gameplay interactions, and the Super Galactic Hub marketplace.

This audit included the contracts that power core marketplace operations (buy and sell flows, reward claiming, withdrawals, and required authorization logic), the gameplay interaction layer that creates and updates game entities and player state, and the token and NFT contracts that manage UAP utility and Super Galactic assets.

- Maintaining strict access control discipline for privileged roles and operational permissions
- Internal testing and regression validation before material contract changes
- Monitoring of contract activity and marketplace operations for operational anomalies
- Conservative deployment practices and controlled change management for on-chain systems
