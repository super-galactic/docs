Super Galactic’s smart contracts have been independently audited to ensure security, reliability, and correctness across the core on-chain systems.

All critical contracts governing token functionality, NFTs, and marketplace interactions have undergone third-party security review prior to public deployment.

### Audit Partner

Super Galactic smart contracts were audited by [**CertiK**](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/ufo-gaming?auditId=UFO#code-security), a leading blockchain security firm known for auditing large-scale Web3 protocols and production-grade smart contract systems.
