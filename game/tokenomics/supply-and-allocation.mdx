UAP has a fixed total supply of **420,000,000,000 tokens**. There is no inflation, no ongoing minting, and no mechanism to increase total supply beyond this cap.

All UAP used across the Super Galactic ecosystem already exists within the fixed supply.

### Fixed Supply Model

The UAP supply model is immutable.

- No new tokens can be minted
- Gameplay does not create supply
- Distribution is a reallocation of existing tokens within the fixed cap

This preserves long-term predictability and prevents inflationary pressure as gameplay participation scales.

### Allocation Breakdown

The largest allocation is reserved for community rewards through the Play to Earn economy.

**Allocation categories reflect reservation, not circulation.**

## Circulating Supply Clarification

Allocation percentages define token reservation, not circulating supply.

Circulating supply is dynamic and changes based on gameplay rewards, player spending, and automated burns. Circulating supply behavior is defined in **Economy Overview → Circulating Supply Dynamics**.

### Allocation Transparency

All supply movements, on-chain balances are transparent and verifiable. There are no hidden emissions, discretionary minting events, or off-protocol supply changes.

Allocation presentation and vesting details may be updated prior to the Token Generation Event. Any updates will be communicated through official channels.
