UAP has a **fixed total supply of 420 billion tokens**.

There is no inflation, no ongoing minting, and no mechanism to increase total supply beyond this cap. All UAP used across the Super Galactic ecosystem already exists within the fixed supply.

---

## Fixed Supply Model

The UAP supply is permanently capped at **420,000,000,000 tokens**.

- No additional tokens can be minted
- Gameplay does not create new supply
- All distribution is reallocation of existing tokens

This design ensures long term predictability and prevents inflationary pressure as the ecosystem grows.

---

## Allocation Overview

The total UAP supply is allocated across two primary purposes:

- **50 percent allocated to the Play to Earn economy**
- **50 percent allocated to ecosystem, liquidity, and long term operations**

This split ensures that gameplay activity is fully supported while maintaining sufficient liquidity and operational stability for the broader ecosystem.

---

## Play to Earn Economy Allocation (50%)

Half of the total UAP supply is allocated to support the Super Galactic Play to Earn economy.

This allocation is used exclusively for:

- Mission rewards earned through gameplay
- Skill based progression incentives
- Long term player engagement

UAP enters circulation only through active gameplay and is continuously balanced by in game token sinks and automated burn mechanisms.

Details on reward distribution and sinks are documented under **Game Economy**.

---

## Multi Chain Deployment

UAP is deployed as a multi chain token to support scalability, low cost gameplay, and accessibility.

- **Ethereum** serves as the origin chain for UAP
- **BNB Chain** and **Avalanche** are used for gameplay related activity

From the total supply:

- **25 percent is bridged to BNB Chain**
- **25 percent is bridged to Avalanche**

Bridging reallocates existing supply across chains and does not increase the total token supply.

---

## Circulating Supply Dynamics

Circulating supply is not fixed.

It dynamically adjusts based on:

- Gameplay rewards entering circulation
- Player spending through progression systems
- Automated burns reducing supply over time

As activity increases, supply reduction mechanisms strengthen, reinforcing scarcity instead of diluting value.

---

## Allocation Transparency

All supply movements, bridging activity, and on chain balances are transparent and verifiable.

There are no hidden emissions, discretionary minting events, or off protocol supply changes.
