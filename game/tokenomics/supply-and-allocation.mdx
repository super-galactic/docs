UAP has a fixed total supply of 420,000,000,000 tokens. There is no inflation, no ongoing minting, and no mechanism to increase total supply beyond this cap. All UAP used across the Super Galactic ecosystem already exists within the fixed supply.

### Fixed Supply Model

- No additional tokens can be minted
- Gameplay does not create new supply
- All distribution is reallocation of existing tokens

This design preserves long-term predictability and avoids inflationary pressure as the ecosystem grows.

### Play to Earn Economy Allocation (50%)

50%  of the total UAP supply is allocated to support the Super Galactic Play to Earn economy, including:

- Mission rewards earned through gameplay
- Skill-based progression incentives
- Long-term player engagement

UAP enters player wallets through active gameplay rewards and is continuously balanced by in-game token sinks and automated burn mechanisms.

Details on reward distribution and sinks are documented under [Game Economy](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/gameplay/gameplay-overview).

### Ecosystem, Liquidity, and Operations Allocation (50%)

50% of the total UAP supply is allocated to liquidity, ecosystem growth, and long term operations. This allocation supports the broader infrastructure around Super Galactic without introducing any new token supply.

| Category              | Allocation (of total supply) | Purpose                                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Liquidity on Ethereum | 25%                          | Supports liquidity provisioning and market accessibility             |
| Team & Advisors       | 5%                           | Supports team and advisor allocation                                 |
| Ecosystem Growth      | 15%                          | Supports ecosystem initiatives, partnerships, and community programs |
| Development Fund      | 5%                           | Supports ongoing development and operational needs                   |

### Multi-Chain Deployment

UAP is deployed as a multi-chain token to support scalability, low-cost gameplay, and accessibility.

- Ethereum serves as the origin chain for UAP
- BNB Chain and Avalanche are used for gameplay-related activity

From the total supply:

- 25% is bridged to BNB Chain
- 25% is bridged to Avalanche
- The remaining supply stays on Ethereum unless bridged

Bridging reallocates existing supply across chains and does not increase the total token supply.

### Circulating Supply Dynamics

Circulating supply is not fixed. It dynamically adjusts based on:

- Gameplay rewards entering player wallets
- Player spending through progression systems
- Automated burns reducing supply over time

As activity increases, supply reduction scales with usage, reinforcing scarcity instead of relying on inflationary supply expansion.

### Allocation Transparency

All supply movements, bridging activity, and on-chain balances are transparent and verifiable. There are no hidden emissions, discretionary minting events, or off-protocol supply changes.

This section describes total supply and allocation only. Reward mechanics, burn logic, and transaction taxes are documented separately under Game Economy and Tokenomics.
