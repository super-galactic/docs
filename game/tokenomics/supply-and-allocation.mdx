UAP has a fixed total supply of 420,000,000,000 tokens. There is no inflation, no ongoing minting, and no mechanism to increase total supply beyond this cap. All UAP used across the Super Galactic ecosystem already exists within the fixed supply.

UAP is used across Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Avalanche, with secondary market trading liquidity provided on Ethereum.

### Fixed Supply Model

UAP follows a fixed supply model. No additional tokens can be minted, gameplay does not create new supply, and all distribution is a reallocation of existing tokens within the capped total supply. This preserves long-term predictability and avoids inflationary pressure as the ecosystem grows.

### Allocation Breakdown

> The largest allocation is reserved for community rewards through the Play to Earn economy.

### Multi-Chain Deployment

UAP is deployed as a multi-chain token to support scalability, low-cost gameplay, and accessibility.

- Ethereum serves as the origin chain for UAP and the primary network for secondary market trading liquidity
- BNB Chain and Avalanche are used for gameplay-related activity

From the total supply:

- 25% is bridged to BNB Chain
- 25% is bridged to Avalanche
- The remaining supply stays on Ethereum unless bridged

Bridging reallocates existing supply across chains and does not increase the total token supply.

### How Players Use UAP Across Chains

Players can acquire UAP on Ethereum, then bridge to the network they use for gameplay.

- Purchase UAP on Ethereum using decentralized exchange liquidity
- Bridge UAP to BNB Chain or Avalanche, depending on where the NFT and gameplay activity is taking place
- Use UAP for progression systems such as upgrades and breeding on the selected network
- Bridge back to Ethereum when access to decentralized exchange liquidity is required

### Circulating Supply Dynamics

Circulating supply is not fixed. It dynamically adjusts based on:

- Gameplay rewards entering player wallets
- Player spending through progression systems
- Automated burns reducing supply over time

As activity increases, supply reduction scales with usage, reinforcing scarcity instead of relying on inflationary supply expansion.

### Allocation Transparency

All supply movements, bridging activity, and on-chain balances are transparent and verifiable. There are no hidden emissions, discretionary minting events, or off-protocol supply changes.

This section describes total supply and allocation only. Reward mechanics, burn logic, and transaction taxes are documented separately under **Game Economy** and **Tokenomics**.
