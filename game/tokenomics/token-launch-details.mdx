UAP becomes transferable and usable at the Token Generation Event (TGE), with settlement and initial liquidity established on **BNB Chain**.

All primary market access is concentrated on BNB Chain at launch to avoid fragmented liquidity and multi-network settlement assumptions.

### Network

- **Network:** BNB Chain
- **Token Standard:** BEP-20
- **Primary Liquidity:** BNB Chain DEX

Liquidity is established exclusively on BNB Chain at launch.

### Liquidity Provision

Liquidity is concentrated on a single network at launch to enforce:

- Single venue price discovery
- Reduced cross-network fragmentation
- Clear settlement and execution assumptions for participants

### Token Generation Event (TGE)

At launch:

- UAP becomes transferable and usable across the **Super Galactic Hub** and **game client**
- Play to Earn PvE is enabled for wallet-connected players with Genesis NFTs
- Gameplay-earned UAP can be claimed through the Super Galactic Hub
- UAP can be spent immediately on progression and asset-related actions

There are no post-TGE mint events or scheduled supply expansions. Fixed supply constraints are defined in Tokenomics → [**Supply & Allocation**](/game/tokenomics/supply-and-allocation).

For eligibility and requirements, see **Game Modes → ** [**PvE Missions (Play to Earn)**](/game/gameplay/game-modes) and **Access & Requirements → **[**Play to Earn Requirements**](/game/gameplay/access-and-requirements)

### Liquidity and Market Access

Initial liquidity is provided to support market access and price discovery. Liquidity provisioning uses existing allocation within the fixed supply model.

- There is no buy tax
- A sell tax applies to supported market transactions

Detailed trading rules are defined in Tokenomics → [**Trading Fees and Taxes.**](/game/tokenomics/trading-fees-and-taxes)

### Post-TGE Supply Behavior

Post-TGE token availability and circulation change only through gameplay entry, player spending, and system-enforced routing.

- Circulating supply behavior is defined in Economy Overview → [Circulating Supply Dynamics](/game/economy/economy-overview#circulating-supply-dynamics)
- Spend routing and burn execution are defined in Burn Mechanisms → [Burn and Game Treasury Split](/game/economy/burn-mechanisms#burn-and-game-treasury-split)
