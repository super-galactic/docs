UAP will be introduced through a formal token launch event. The launch is designed to activate UAP utility across gameplay systems and the Super Galactic Hub, with market access introduced once core usage is live.

### Purpose

The purpose of the UAP token launch is to enable UAP utility across supported systems, including claiming gameplay rewards through the Hub and spending UAP on progression and asset actions.

### Token Generation Event (TGE)

At launch:

- UAP becomes transferable and usable across supported systems
- Gameplay earned UAP can be claimed through the Super Galactic Hub
- UAP can be spent immediately on progression and asset related actions

There are no ongoing emissions introduced at launch. All circulating UAP originates from the fixed total supply.

### Liquidity and Market Access

Initial liquidity is provided to support basic market access and price discovery. Liquidity provisioning uses existing allocation within the fixed supply model.

- There is no buy tax
- A sell tax applies to supported market transactions

Detailed trading rules are documented under **Tokenomics **→ [**Market Transaction Tax.**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/tokenomics/market-transaction-tax)

### Post-TGE Supply Behavior

Following launch:

- Player distribution remains gameplay-driven
- Supply dynamics are governed by in-game activity
- Burn and Game Treasury mechanisms operate automatically
- There are no scheduled inflation events or post launch minting phases
