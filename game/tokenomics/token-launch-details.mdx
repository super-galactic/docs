UAP is introduced through a Token Generation Event (TGE). The launch activates UAP utility across gameplay systems and the Super Galactic Hub, with secondary market access enabled through Ethereum liquidity once core usage is live.

For total supply and allocation, see **Tokenomics** → **Supply and Allocation**.

### Purpose

The UAP token launch enables utility across supported systems, including claiming gameplay rewards through the Hub and spending UAP on progression and asset actions.

### Token Generation Event (TGE)

At launch:

- UAP becomes transferable and usable across supported systems
- Gameplay earned UAP can be claimed through the Super Galactic Hub
- UAP can be spent immediately on progression and asset related actions

There are no ongoing emissions introduced at launch. All circulating UAP originates from the fixed total supply.

### Liquidity and Market Access

Initial liquidity is provided to support basic market access and price discovery. Liquidity provisioning uses existing allocation within the fixed supply model.

- There is no buy tax
- A sell tax applies to supported market transactions

Detailed trading rules are documented under **Tokenomics** → **Trading Fees and Taxes.**

### Post-TGE Supply Behavior

Following launch:

- Player distribution remains gameplay-driven
- Supply dynamics are governed by in-game activity
- Burn and Game Treasury mechanisms operate automatically
- There are no scheduled inflation events or post launch minting phases

For burn logic and system sinks, see **Game Economy** → **Burn Mechanisms**.
