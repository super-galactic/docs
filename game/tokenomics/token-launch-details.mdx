UAP will be introduced to the ecosystem through a formal token launch event.

The launch is designed to activate UAP utility across gameplay systems and the Super Galactic Hub, rather than serving solely as a speculative market event.

## Launch Purpose

The primary purpose of the UAP token launch is to activate utility across gameplay systems and the Super Galactic Hub.

Super Galactic prioritises building an active player base and live gameplay engagement before expanding token market participation, ensuring that UAP is introduced into an ecosystem with demonstrated usage rather than as a standalone speculative asset.

## Availability at Launch

At launch:

- UAP becomes transferable and usable across supported systems
- Gameplay earned UAP can be claimed through the Super Galactic Hub
- UAP can be spent immediately on progression and asset related actions

There are no ongoing emissions introduced at launch. All circulating UAP originates from the fixed total supply.

## Liquidity and Market Access

Initial liquidity is provided to support basic market access and price discovery.

- There is no buy tax
- A sell tax applies to market transactions as documented separately

Detailed trading rules are covered under \*\*Tokenomics → \*\*[**Market Transaction Tax.**](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/tokenomics/market-transaction-tax)

## Post Launch Behavior

Following launch:

- UAP distribution remains gameplay driven
- Supply dynamics are governed by in game activity
- Burn and treasury mechanisms operate automatically

There are no scheduled inflation events or post launch minting phases.

---

## Design Principles

The UAP token launch follows these principles:

- Utility first, speculation second
- Live systems before market access
- Conservative and transparent deployment
- Long term ecosystem sustainability

This approach ensures a stable transition from pre launch systems to a fully active token economy.
