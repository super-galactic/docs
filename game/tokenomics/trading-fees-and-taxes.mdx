</Note>

### Super Galactic Hub Marketplace Fee

The Super Galactic Hub marketplace charges a 2.5% fee on successful sales executed through the marketplace. The fee is displayed before the user confirms the transaction. The seller receives the net amount after the fee is applied.

### Where This Applies

The UAP sell tax and marketplace fee apply to different actions and are enforced separately. In-game UAP spending is not affected by trading taxes or marketplace fees. In-game spending follows the burn and Game Treasury split documented under [**Burn Mechanisms**.](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/economy/burn-mechanisms)

### Purpose

Trading fees and taxes provide an additional system lever to support long-term ecosystem operations, including operational flexibility, liquidity support where required, and treasury operations such as additional burns when needed.
