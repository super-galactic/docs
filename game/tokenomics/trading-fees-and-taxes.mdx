A Market Transaction Tax is applied to supported marketplace sell transactions involving UAP denominated assets. This mechanism applies only to market sells and does not affect in-game spending.

### Tax Rates

| Transaction Type | Tax Rate |
| ---------------- | -------: |
| Buy              | 0%       |
| Sell             | 10%      |

<Note>
  This tax applies to supported marketplace sell flows. In-game UAP spending follows the burn and Game Treasury split documented under **Game Economy → Burn Mechanisms**.
</Note>

### How It Works

When a sell transaction is executed on supported marketplace contracts, the tax is deducted automatically as part of the transaction. The seller receives the net amount after tax.

### Purpose

The Market Transaction Tax provides an additional system lever to support long term ecosystem balance, including:

- Maintaining operational flexibility for ecosystem initiatives
- Supporting liquidity and market stability where required
- Enabling discretionary actions such as treasury management or burns when needed

This section documents market tax behavior only. Gameplay reward and burn logic is documented separately under Game Economy.

## Trading Fees and Taxes

Super Galactic applies two separate charges depending on where a trade happens:

- **Token sell tax (10%)** applies when **UAP is sold on Uniswap**
- **Marketplace fee (2.5%)** applies when an **NFT sale is executed on the Super Galactic Hub marketplace**

These charges are independent. A marketplace sale does not trigger the Uniswap sell tax unless the seller separately sells UAP on Uniswap.

### Summary

| Location | Charge | When it applies | Who pays |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Uniswap | **10% sell tax** | When a user sells UAP | Seller |
| Super Galactic Hub Marketplace | **2.5% marketplace fee** | When a listed item sells successfully | Seller |

### Token Sell Tax (Uniswap)

When UAP is sold on Uniswap, a **10% sell tax** is applied at execution. The seller receives the net amount after tax.

This tax is intended to support long-term ecosystem operations and treasury management alongside the in-game burn model.

### Marketplace Fee (Super Galactic Hub)

When an item is sold through the Super Galactic Hub marketplace, a **2.5% marketplace fee** is applied to the sale proceeds.

The fee is shown to the user before confirming a listing or sale transaction, similar to standard marketplace platforms. The seller receives the net amount after the fee is applied.

### Important Notes

- **In-game spending is not affected by Uniswap trading taxes or marketplace fees.** In-game spending follows the burn and Game Treasury split documented under **Game Economy → Burn Mechanisms**.
- Fees and taxes described on this page apply only to trading and marketplace execution, not to gameplay reward generation or progression spending.
