A Market Transaction Tax is applied to supported marketplace sell transactions involving UAP denominated assets. This mechanism applies only to market sells and does not affect in-game spending.

### Tax Rates

| Transaction Type | Tax Rate |
| ---------------- | -------: |
| Buy              | 0%       |
| Sell             | 10%      |

<Note>
  This tax applies to supported marketplace sell flows. In-game UAP spending follows the burn and Game Treasury split documented under **Game Economy → Burn Mechanisms**.
</Note>

### How It Works

When a sell transaction is executed on supported marketplace contracts, the tax is deducted automatically as part of the transaction. The seller receives the net amount after tax.

### Purpose

The Market Transaction Tax provides an additional system lever to support long term ecosystem balance, including:

- Maintaining operational flexibility for ecosystem initiatives
- Supporting liquidity and market stability where required
- Enabling discretionary actions such as treasury management or burns when needed
