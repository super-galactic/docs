This page defines the fees and taxes that apply to UAP trading and marketplace activity. It distinguishes clearly between market transactions and in-game spending.

Trading fees and taxes apply only to **market activity**. In-game UAP spending is governed separately under the economy system.

### Summary

| Location                                | Charge               | When it applies                       | Who pays |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------- |
| Decentralized exchange (DEX, BNB Chain) | 10% sell tax         | When UAP is sold on a DEX             | Seller   |
| Super Galactic Hub Marketplace          | 2.5% marketplace fee | When a listed item sells successfully | Seller   |

### UAP Sell Tax

UAP has **no buy tax**.

A **10% sell tax** applies when UAP is sold through decentralized exchange trades executed on BNB Chain.

- The tax applies only to sell-side DEX transactions
- The seller receives the net amount after tax
- Buy transactions are not taxed

This tax does not apply to in-game spending or progression actions.

### Super Galactic Hub Marketplace Fee

The Super Galactic Hub marketplace charges a **2.5% fee** on successful asset sales executed through the marketplace.

- The fee is displayed before transaction confirmation
- The seller receives the net proceeds after the fee is applied
- Buyers do not pay marketplace fees

Marketplace fees apply only to asset sales within the Hub and are separate from UAP trading taxes.

### Scope and Separation

Trading taxes and marketplace fees apply only to **market transactions**.

They do not apply to:

- In-game upgrades
- Progression spending
- Breeding execution
- Any gameplay-related UAP consumption

All in-game UAP spending follows the automated routing defined in → Burn Mechanisms → [Burn and Game Treasury Split](/game/economy/burn-mechanisms#burn-and-game-treasury-split).

### Purpose

Trading fees and taxes exist to:

- Maintain clear separation between gameplay economics and market activity
- Support operational sustainability without altering gameplay rewards
- Avoid reliance on inflationary supply expansion

They do not modify reward rates, progression mechanics, or circulating supply rules.
