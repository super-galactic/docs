Super Galactic is a playable action RPG shooter with optional on-chain ownership and settlement, where rewards enter circulation only through eligible gameplay and are constrained by fixed supply, sinks, and burn enforcement. The game is playable without a wallet or upfront asset purchase. Players can experience the core gameplay, combat systems, and progression flow before engaging with ownership mechanics. Players can evaluate core combat and progression before opting into ownership or earning features.

The project has been in active development for over four years across multiple market cycles. Building began during the 2021 bull market and continued through the subsequent bear market, with uninterrupted development, iterative testing, and continuous feedback from the community across alpha and beta phases. This process prioritised skill-based gameplay, progression depth, and economy constraints designed for long-run operation.

Tokens and NFTs are used for progression spending, asset ownership, and marketplace settlement, not as a required entry to access core gameplay. Progression eligibility is earned through gameplay. Rewards are generated through eligible PvE completion and claimed through the Hub under defined caps and cooldown constraints.

The custom-built Super Galactic Hub is already live, supporting asset management, progression visibility, and on-chain ownership, while the game itself is playable in open beta. At launch, UAP is activated on BNB Chain as the primary network for trading and liquidity.
