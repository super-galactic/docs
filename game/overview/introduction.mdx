Super Galactic is a competitive action shooter built around skill based combat, progression, and long term player ownership.

The game is designed to be played immediately, without requiring a wallet, digital assets, or prior knowledge of Web3 systems. Players can experience the full core gameplay first, then choose whether they want to engage with deeper progression and ownership systems over time.

Super Galactic has been in active development for over four years, shaped through continuous iteration, live testing, and long term system design.

Super Galactic is currently playable in open beta and continues to evolve through ongoing development and player feedback.

### Design Principles

Super Galactic is guided by a small set of design principles that shape every system in the game.

**Gameplay comes first**\
Combat, movement, and moment to moment decision making are the foundation of the experience. All progression and economy systems exist to support gameplay, not replace it.

**Access is separate from ownership**\
Anyone can play Super Galactic without upfront cost. Ownership enhances progression and long term depth, but never blocks access to the game itself.

**Progression is earned, not granted**\
Advancement is tied to performance, activity, and player choice. There are no passive shortcuts that bypass gameplay.

**Systems are designed to endure**\
Super Galactic is built for long term operation. Every system is designed with balance, sustainability, and iteration in mind rather than short term extraction.
