Super Galactic is a play to earn game built on the belief that digital ownership, fair economies, and engaging gameplay must coexist to create lasting value.

The project originated on 30 June 2021 under the name _The Truth_, a community driven concept that emerged during the early experimentation phase of on chain culture. As the community grew and the vision became more defined, the project evolved into the UFO Gaming brand, marking the transition from concept to execution and the beginning of active game development for Super Galactic.

As the ecosystem expanded, the broader UFO Gaming infrastructure transitioned into the [INTO.SPACE](http://INTO.SPACE) ecosystem, introducing the SPACE token on the Solana network. This separation allowed the ecosystem to scale beyond a single product while preserving clarity between infrastructure and individual applications.

Super Galactic continues forward as an independent game within this broader ecosystem. Its economy is powered by UAP, a capped supply token designed exclusively for in game utility rather than speculation. UAP underpins progression, upgrades, breeding, and long term player engagement. The token has completed a full CertiK audit, and the game is currently live in open beta, positioning Super Galactic for the launch of its play to earn economy.

Unlike early generation play to earn models that relied on unchecked inflation and short term incentives, Super Galactic is designed with sustainability as a core principle. Scarce NFTs, controlled progression systems, and deliberate economic sinks form the foundation of a game that rewards participation without compromising long term balance.

This document outlines the design principles, economic structure, and technical foundation of Super Galactic. It is intended to provide players, partners, and investors with a clear understanding of how the game operates today and how it is positioned to evolve over time.
