Super Galactic is a live real-time action RPG shooter where rewards enter circulation only through eligible PvE mission completion and are constrained by fixed supply, progression sinks, and enforced burns. Core gameplay is wallet-free, allowing players to evaluate combat and progression before opting into ownership or earning-enabled actions.

The project has been in active development for over four years across multiple market cycles, with iterative testing and community feedback across alpha and beta phases.

The Super Galactic Hub is the application and marketplace layer for asset management, progression visibility, reward claiming, and settlement for ownership-enabled actions.
