UFO Gaming began as a gaming ecosystem built on Ethereum and expanded rapidly during the early adoption wave of on-chain gaming. As the market evolved, the opportunity to align with a broader and more modular ecosystem led to the migration into the [INTO.SPACE](http://INTO.SPACE) network. The migration introduced the SPACE token on Solana, which serves the wider ecosystem across multiple products.

Super Galactic remains one of the core products of the legacy brand, now operating independently while benefiting from the expanded visibility and infrastructure of the [INTO.SPACE](http://INTO.SPACE) ecosystem. The game maintains its foundation on Ethereum for asset ownership and gameplay logic. It will expand into Avalanche and BNB as part of a multichain strategy designed to reduce congestion, support scalability and reach wider player markets.

The previous UFO and UAP token structure has been replaced with a cleaner and more efficient model. The original UFO token no longer serves gameplay functions. Instead, UAP is positioned as the dedicated game economy token used for breeding and in game sinks. This separation prevents cross system inflation and ensures that Super Galactic can operate a stable player focused economy.

The Plasma airdrop and minting phase represented the final chapter of the early UFO Gaming asset distribution. It established the supply of Genesis and Origin assets for Super Galactic and is now closed. Network snapshots, distribution and the Plasma lifecycle have been completed.

With the transition complete, the ecosystem is now structured in a way that benefits investors, players and long term asset holders through clarity, sustainability and focused token utility.
