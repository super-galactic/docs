title: "Ecosystem Architecture"
---

Super Galactic is designed as a modular game ecosystem, where gameplay, assets, and economic systems operate together while remaining adaptable across multiple blockchains. This architecture prioritises scalability, security, and long term sustainability rather than dependency on a single network or token.

### **Separation of Infrastructure and Game Economy**

The broader ecosystem infrastructure operates within the [INTO.SPACE](http://INTO.SPACE) network, where the SPACE token exists as an ecosystem level asset on the Solana network. Super Galactic is developed as an independent application within this wider ecosystem.

The game economy itself is powered by UAP, an Ethereum based token designed exclusively for in game utility. This separation ensures that Super Galactic’s economic balance is not influenced by external ecosystem dynamics and allows the game to maintain a focused and predictable progression model.

### **Multichain Game Deployment**

Super Galactic is developed with a multichain strategy from the outset. While UAP originates on Ethereum, the game is designed to launch and operate across Avalanche and BNB, with UAP bridged to support gameplay on these networks.

This approach allows the game to benefit from:

- Reduced transaction costs
- Improved scalability
- Access to broader player communities
- Flexibility as network conditions evolve

Players interact with the game on the network that best suits performance and cost efficiency, while maintaining consistent asset ownership and progression.

### **On Chain Assets and Ownership**

All core in game assets, including Genesis Origin UFOeps, weapons, and equipment, are represented as NFTs. These assets are scarce by design and fully owned by players.

Ownership is independent of gameplay sessions and persists across supported networks. Progression, upgrades, and enhancements are recorded on chain, ensuring transparency and verifiable asset history.

### **Security and Reliability**

Super Galactic’s smart contracts have undergone a full audit by CertiK. This audit covers the UAP token and core economic components, providing assurance around contract integrity and risk management.

By combining audited contracts, controlled token supply, and modular deployment, the ecosystem is structured to support live operations while remaining adaptable to future expansion.
