title: "Ecosystem Architecture"
---

Super Galactic is built as a connected system where gameplay, progression, ownership, and economy operate together without relying on a single dependency. Each layer is designed to function independently while remaining interoperable with the others.

This structure allows the game to evolve over time, introduce new features safely, and maintain balance without disrupting the core player experience.

### Core System Layers

Super Galactic is composed of four primary layers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Game Client">
    The game client is where all moment to moment gameplay occurs. Combat, movement, matchmaking, and progression input originate here. The client is designed to remain accessible to all players regardless of ownership status.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ownership Layer">
    The ownership layer represents player owned assets such as characters and equipment. These assets enhance progression and long term depth but are never required to access or enjoy the game.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Economy Layer">
    The economy layer governs rewards, spending, sinks, and scarcity controls. It is designed to reinforce gameplay loops rather than override them. Economic systems respond to player activity and progression instead of operating independently.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Super Galactic Hub">
    The Super Galactic Hub serves as the external interface for asset management, marketplace activity, and future systems such as renting. It connects ownership and economy features without introducing friction into gameplay.

### Separation of Responsibilities

Each layer has a clearly defined responsibility.

Gameplay systems focus exclusively on play quality and competitive balance.\
Ownership systems focus on persistence and progression depth.\
Economic systems focus on sustainability and long term equilibrium.\
The Hub focuses on access, management, and external interaction.

By separating responsibilities, Super Galactic avoids common failure points where changes in one system destabilize others.

### Designed for Iteration and Longevity

This architecture allows Super Galactic to evolve through live development.

New gameplay modes can be added without altering ownership rules.\
New assets can be introduced without inflating the economy.\
Economic parameters can be adjusted without affecting gameplay fairness.

These boundaries make it possible to respond to player behavior, balance data, and long term growth without requiring structural resets.
