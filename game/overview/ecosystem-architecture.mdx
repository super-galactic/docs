title: "Ecosystem Architecture"
---

Super Galactic is built as a **fully integrated, multi system ecosystem** where gameplay, asset ownership, and on chain state remain synchronized at all times.

The architecture is designed to ensure that player actions performed in the game client or the Super Galactic Hub are reflected consistently across all connected systems, without manual syncing, duplicated actions, or fragmented state.

---

## Core System Components

The Super Galactic ecosystem consists of three primary layers:

- The Game Client
- The Super Galactic Hub
- The Blockchain Layer

Each layer has a distinct role while operating as part of a single cohesive system.

> The Super Galactic ecosystem operates across multiple blockchain networks to support scalability, low cost gameplay, and asset ownership.

---

## Game Client

The game client is built on Unity and is responsible for real time gameplay, combat, progression, and player interaction.

Within the game client:

- Players complete missions and earn rewards
- Progression and upgrades are executed through gameplay
- Asset performance, stats, and evolution are calculated in real time

The game client is the source of gameplay activity and progression state.

---

## Super Galactic Hub

The Super Galactic Hub is the unified application layer for asset management, progression visibility, and ownership actions.

Within the Hub, players can:

- View and manage owned NFTs
- View UAP balances and claim earned UAP
- Initiate breeding and asset related actions
- View progression, stat updates, and evolution history

The Hub acts as the bridge between gameplay state and on chain ownership, providing a single interface for managing assets across the ecosystem.

---

## Blockchain Layer

The blockchain layer is responsible for:

- Token ownership and transfers
- NFT ownership and lifecycle events
- Burn execution and treasury flows
- Transaction transparency and verification

All on chain actions are executed through audited smart contracts and are independently verifiable.

---

## Cross System Synchronization

Super Galactic is designed with full bidirectional synchronization between systems.

- Gameplay actions update asset state visible in the Hub
- Hub initiated actions reflect back into gameplay systems
- Ownership and token balances remain consistent across all interfaces

This ensures that players always interact with a single source of truth, regardless of where an action is initiated.

---

## Reward Flow Architecture

Reward generation and claiming follows a clear system flow:

- Gameplay activity generates reward data in the game client
- Earned rewards are recorded and surfaced in the Hub
- Players claim rewards through the Hub
- Claim actions execute on chain transactions

Each step is tracked, timestamped, and transparently recorded.

---

## Transaction Visibility and Transparency

All on chain actions initiated through the ecosystem provide:

- Transaction hashes
- Timestamps
- On chain verification

Players can view historical activity related to rewards, claims, and asset actions directly through the Hub interface, with links to on chain data where applicable.

---

## System Design Principles

The ecosystem architecture is built around the following principles:

- Single source of truth across systems
- Real time synchronization without manual intervention
- Clear separation between gameplay logic and ownership logic
- Transparency and verifiability for all on chain actions

This ensures reliability, scalability, and long term maintainability.
