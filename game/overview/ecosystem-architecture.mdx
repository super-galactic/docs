title: "Ecosystem Architecture"
---

Super Galactic is built on a modular architecture designed to support real-time gameplay, persistent progression, and a controlled on-chain economy without compromising performance or accessibility.

The system is intentionally separated into distinct layers, each responsible for a specific role. Only validated outcomes and confirmed user actions are settled on chain, keeping gameplay responsive while ensuring economic actions remain transparent and verifiable.

This separation allows the game to scale, evolve, and iterate over time while maintaining clear boundaries between gameplay logic, player state, and economic settlement.

### Layered System Design

The ecosystem is structured across three layers that operate independently and synchronize through validated outcomes.

1. Gameplay Layer (Game Client)
2. Application Layer (Super Galactic Hub)
3. On-Chain Settlement Layer (supported networks)

### Gameplay Layer

The gameplay layer is responsible for all real time interactions.

This includes:

- Combat and mission execution
- Player movement and abilities
- Match outcomes and performance tracking
- Local game state and responsiveness

This layer is optimized for speed and player experience. No blockchain interactions occur during active gameplay, ensuring low latency and uninterrupted play.

### Application Layer

The application layer acts as the coordination and synchronization layer between gameplay and on chain systems.

Its responsibilities include:

- Player account state
- Asset management and inventory
- Progression tracking
- Reward eligibility and claims
- Data synchronization across systems

This layer ensures that gameplay results are correctly recorded, validated, and prepared for settlement without exposing players to unnecessary technical complexity.

### On Chain Settlement Layer

The on chain layer handles ownership, verification, and economic finality.

This includes:

- UAP token logic
- NFT ownership and metadata
- Supply control mechanisms
- Burn and sink execution
- Transaction verification

Only validated outcomes are settled on chain. This design minimizes cost, avoids unnecessary transactions, and ensures economic actions are transparent and verifiable.

### Extensibility and Future Systems

The modular structure allows new systems to be introduced without disrupting existing gameplay.

Future features such as expanded progression paths, additional asset interactions, and marketplace functionality can be integrated at the application or settlement layer while preserving core gameplay integrity.

This approach ensures that Super Galactic can evolve over time without sacrificing stability, balance, or player experience.
