title: "Competitive Landscape"
---

The current games market can be broadly grouped into three categories, each with distinct strengths and limitations. Understanding these models helps clarify where Super Galactic fits and what it is designed to address.

### Traditional Web2 Games

Conventional online games deliver polished gameplay, stable progression systems, and large player bases. However, all progression, items, and achievements remain fully controlled by the publisher. Players invest time and money, but have no ownership or persistence outside the game itself. When a title sunsets or rules change, accumulated value is lost.

These models are effective at scale, but they treat player contribution as disposable rather than durable.

### Early Play to Earn and Asset-First Games

Early Play to Earn titles demonstrated that on-chain ownership and player-driven economies are possible. However, many prioritised token emissions and asset sales over gameplay quality. Weak core loops, inflationary rewards, and extractive mechanics led to short engagement cycles and declining player trust.

In these systems, earning became the primary reason to play, rather than a byproduct of skill or mastery. As rewards diminished, participation dropped.

### Hybrid Web3 Games

More recent projects attempt to blend traditional gameplay with on-chain assets. While this improves production quality, many still struggle to align progression, ownership, and economic balance. In some cases, blockchain systems are introduced too early or too deeply into gameplay, increasing complexity without improving player experience.

These approaches often lack clear boundaries between what must be on-chain and what should remain off-chain for performance and accessibility reasons.

### Super Galactic’s Position

Super Galactic is designed around a different set of priorities.

- Gameplay is the primary driver of engagement
- Ownership and earning are optional extensions of play
- Economic systems are constrained, sink-driven, and integrated into progression
- On-chain execution is used where it adds durability and transparency, not where it introduces friction

Rather than competing on surface features or token incentives, Super Galactic differentiates itself through system design and long-term intent. The game is built to support sustained engagement, controlled economic participation, and gradual expansion without requiring players to understand or manage blockchain complexity upfront.

### **Design Comparison: First-Generation P2E vs Super Galactic**

The following comparison provides structural context for readers familiar with early Play-to-Earn models. It is not intended as a critique of any specific project.

| Category                | Axie Infinity                      | Super Galactic                                       |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Game Type**      | Card-driven gameplay               | Real-time action RPG shooter                         |
| **Gameplay Complexity** | Low mechanical complexity          | High mechanical and skill complexity                 |
| **Multiplayer Support** | Primarily asynchronous             | PvE and multiplayer modes (e.g. TDM)                 |
| **Asset Format**        | 2D or static assets                | Fully rigged 3D game-ready assets                    |
| **Asset Evolution**     | Limited or static traits           | Visual and functional evolution at engine level      |
| **Token Supply Model**  | Inflationary emissions             | Fixed supply, with deflationary sinks and burns      |
| **Reward Source**       | Emission driven rewards            | Gameplay driven rewards with controlled distribution |
| **Earning Mechanism**   | Time and repetition driven         | Performance and progression driven                   |
| **Supply Control**      | Weak or reactive                   | Embedded, automated controls                         |
| **Token Sinks**         | Insufficient relative to emissions | Core progression and upgrade systems                 |
| **Economic Loop**       | Linear (earn → sell)               | Closed-loop (earn → spend → burn)                    |
| **Retention Driver**    | Financial incentives               | Gameplay mastery and progression depth               |
| **Ecosystem Structure** | Dual token economy                 | Single token ecosystem                               |
