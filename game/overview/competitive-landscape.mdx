This section classifies relevant market models and the primary failure modes that matter for gameplay retention and economy stability.

### Traditional Web2 Games

Traditional Web2 titles typically deliver high production gameplay and mature progression systems at scale. Progression state and item ownership remain publisher-controlled and revocable. Players invest time and spend, but do not have enforceable persistence or transfer rights outside the title. If a title sunsets or rules change materially, accumulated progression value can be deprecated.

These models scale, but player-earned value remains non-durable by design.

### Early Play to Earn and Asset-First Games

Early Play to Earn titles demonstrated on-chain settlement and transferable assets. Many optimised for emissions and primary sales before establishing durable gameplay loops. Weak core loops plus inflationary reward issuance without proportional sinks led to unstable economies and short engagement cycles.

Earning often became the primary loop, rather than a constrained output of gameplay completion. When rewards declined, participation typically contracted.

### Hybrid Web3 Games

Hybrid models attempt to combine high production gameplay with on-chain ownership and settlement. Common failure modes include unclear on-chain vs off-chain boundaries, progression systems that do not create sufficient sinks, and reward pacing that is not extraction-bounded. When on-chain execution is coupled to high-frequency gameplay, latency and user friction increase without adding functional value.

A clear boundary is required: gameplay execution remains off-chain, while ownership, trading, and economic finality settle on-chain.

### Super Galactic’s Position

Super Galactic enforces explicit system boundaries and economy constraints.

- Gameplay execution is off-chain for performance and determinism
- Demo access is wallet-free, ownership is required only for earning-eligible PvE
- Rewards entry is bounded and claim-based, with fixed supply, sinks, and automated burn enforcement
- On-chain settlement is limited to ownership, marketplace execution, and economic finality

Differentiation is implemented through system design: clear layer separation, constrained reward entry, and progression-linked sinks. The system supports repeatable engagement with controlled economic participation, while keeping blockchain complexity optional until ownership or settlement actions are required.

### **Design Comparison: First-Generation P2E vs Super Galactic**

The following comparison provides structural context for readers familiar with early Play-to-Earn models. It is not intended as a critique of any specific project.

| Token Supply Model  | Inflationary emissions              | Fixed total supply, circulation controlled through capped extraction and sinks |
| Reward Source       | Emission driven rewards             | PvE only, claim based rewards with caps and cooldowns                          |
| Earning Mechanism   | Time and repetition driven          | Performance based within fixed caps, progression improves consistency          |
