### **First Generation Play to Earn Games**

Early Play to Earn titles demonstrated that players were willing to engage with blockchain based games when financial incentives were introduced. Games such as Axie Infinity achieved rapid growth by combining simple gameplay with token based rewards and NFT ownership.

However, these models prioritised reward distribution over long term economic balance. Unlimited or loosely controlled token minting led to inflationary pressure, while player behaviour became increasingly extractive. As rewards declined, engagement dropped, exposing the fragility of economies that relied primarily on continuous emissions rather than sustainable gameplay loops.

These outcomes were not failures of the concept of Play to Earn itself, but of economic design.

### **Axie Infinity and Comparable Models**

Axie Infinity remains a defining case study for the Play to Earn sector. Its success validated player owned economies, but its challenges highlighted several structural risks:

- Unlimited or highly elastic reward supply
- Insufficient token sinks relative to emissions
- Gameplay depth secondary to earning incentives
- Player churn driven by declining returns

Similar patterns emerged across other early Web3 games that focused on rapid growth rather than long term retention and balance.

These lessons have since shaped investor and player expectations, shifting demand toward more disciplined economic frameworks.

### **What Super Galactic Does Differently**

Super Galactic was designed with these lessons in mind.

The game operates with a capped UAP supply, ensuring that rewards are finite and scarcity is preserved. Progression is tied to meaningful in game actions such as upgrades, breeding, and asset enhancement rather than passive farming. Token sinks are embedded throughout the gameplay loop, absorbing earned tokens and supporting long term equilibrium.

Gameplay depth, progression systems, and visual evolution of assets are prioritised to encourage engagement beyond financial incentives. Economic participation enhances gameplay rather than replacing it.

By separating ecosystem infrastructure from the game economy and focusing UAP exclusively on in game utility, Super Galactic avoids the overlapping incentives that contributed to instability in earlier models.

### **Positioning Within the Current Market**

As Web3 gaming matures, the competitive landscape is shifting away from speculative reward models toward sustainable game driven ecosystems. Players increasingly value progression, ownership, and longevity, while investors prioritise disciplined supply mechanics and proven execution.

Super Galactic positions itself within this new generation of Play to Earn games. With an audited token, live open beta gameplay, scarce NFTs, and a controlled economic design, the project reflects an evolution of the Play to Earn model rather than a repetition of its early mistakes.
