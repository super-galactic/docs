Super Galactic is a top-down action shooter RPG built around manual execution, loadout strategy, and progression through repeatable missions and matches.

Combat is real time and input driven. Outcomes depend on aiming, positioning, timing, and team coordination. Gameplay does not use idle mechanics or automated resolution loops.

### Core Gameplay Loop

- **Select a character and loadout**\
  Choose a Genesis character and equip melee and ranged weapons based on preferred playstyle and available ratings.
- **Enter a mission or match**\
  Play PvE missions or competitive multiplayer modes depending on the selected mode.
- **Execute objectives through combat**\
  Complete objectives through player input and coordination. There are no hidden modifiers that override performance.
- **Generate outcomes and progression state**\
  Mission and match results produce recorded outcomes used for progression and, where applicable, rewards eligibility.
- **Spend into upgrades**\
  Players use progression outputs and UAP spending to upgrade characters and weapons, increasing rating and enabling more consistent performance at higher PvE difficulties.

For reward eligibility and claim flow, see Economy → Rewards System.

### Combat and Controls

Players control a single character with free movement, aiming, and ability usage. Weapons and abilities shape playstyle but do not replace execution.

Super Galactic does not apply hidden combat multipliers or matchmaking modifiers that influence outcomes. Performance is determined by player decisions and progression state.

### Progression Through Play

Progression is earned through gameplay activity and reinvested into upgrades. Advancement reflects mission completion, repetition, and build refinement rather than time based boosts.

### Multiplayer and Replayability

Super Galactic supports PvE and PvP modes. PvP is designed for competitive play and does not generate UAP rewards. PvE is the earning eligible mode and is structured around difficulty tiers and objective completion.

Mode rules and access differences are documented in Gameplay → Game Modes.

### Notes

- Gameplay logic runs off chain for latency and responsiveness
- On chain actions occur only when players claim rewards or approve UAP spending through the Hub
