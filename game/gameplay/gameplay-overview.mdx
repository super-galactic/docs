Super Galactic is a top down arcade action shooter RPG focused on skill based PvE gameplay, progression, and long term asset development. Players control Genesis Origin UFOeps, complete missions, upgrade characters and weapons, and build specialised loadouts over time.

The game is designed to be accessible first and ownership driven second. Players can experience Super Galactic without a wallet, while full progression and Play to Earn mechanics unlock through on chain assets.

### **Platforms and Access**

Super Galactic is available across multiple platforms:

- [**Desktop download**](https://storage.ufogaming.io/ufogaming-game-cdn/supergalactic_launcher/production/SupergalacticWin64Launcher-v0.1.0.exe)
- [**Browser based gameplay**](https://sg.ufogaming.io)
- [**Android devices**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.UFOGaming.SupergalacticGame)

Players can start playing instantly without a wallet. To unlock full Web3 ownership, progression, and Play to Earn functionality, players connect a supported wallet and acquire the required NFT assets.

### Server Regions and Matchmaking

Super Galactic operates on globally distributed game servers to support real-time gameplay.

The game currently supports multiple regions, including:

- North America
- Europe
- Asia

For multiplayer modes, players must be connected to the same server region to matchmake. This ensures low-latency combat, fair encounters, and consistent gameplay performance.

### **Core Gameplay Loop**

The core gameplay loop is built around active participation:

- Select a Genesis Origin UFOep
- Equip a melee and ranged weapon
- Enter PvE missions
- Complete objectives through skill based combat
- Earn rewards based on performance
- Reinvest rewards into upgrades and progression

This loop reinforces long term engagement, where progression directly improves combat effectiveness and earning potential.

> Combat outcomes are driven by player skill, positioning, and loadout optimisation rather than automated or idle mechanics.

### **Play to Earn Design**

Play to Earn in Super Galactic is tied exclusively to PvE mission completion. UAP is earned exclusively through successful gameplay rather than passive activity.

Earning potential is influenced by:

- Genesis rating
- Weapon rating
- Rarity and upgrade levels
- Combat performance

UAP is then used to:

- Upgrade Genesis body parts
- Upgrade weapon NFTs
- Prepare for future systems such as breeding

By requiring reinvestment into progression, the Play to Earn system supports long term balance and avoids extractive reward behaviour seen in earlier models.

### **Progression and Requirements**

Super Galactic is designed to minimise barriers to entry while preserving meaningful progression.

Players only need **one Genesis Origin UFOep NFT** to unlock Play to Earn PvE gameplay and begin earning UAP. Unlike early Play to Earn models that required multiple NFTs to participate, Super Galactic allows players to onboard immediately with a single core asset.

All players are provided with a **starter weapon pack** that includes both a melee and a ranged weapon. These starter weapons are non NFT and non upgradable, and are intended to allow players to experience the game and complete early missions without additional purchases.

Weapon NFTs are optional but recommended for players seeking deeper progression. NFT weapons can be upgraded using UAP, unlock perks, increase ratings, and enhance combat performance, providing long term advantages without being mandatory for entry.

This approach preserves fair access to gameplay while rewarding deeper long term progression.
