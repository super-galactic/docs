Super Galactic is a real time competitive action shooter focused on movement, precision, and decision making. Every match is designed to reward mechanical skill, situational awareness, and team coordination rather than passive progression or automated outcomes.

Gameplay is fast paced and skill driven, with an emphasis on mastery over time. Progression systems enhance depth, but success in matches is determined by player performance.

### Core Combat Experience

Combat in Super Galactic is built around direct player input.

Movement, aiming, positioning, and timing are central to success. Players are expected to actively engage with encounters, adapt to opponents, and make tactical decisions in real time.

There are no idle mechanics or background automation. Every action in a match is the result of player choice.

### Match Structure

Matches are session based and self contained.

Each match begins on equal footing, with no guaranteed advantage based solely on ownership or progression. Loadouts and progression choices influence playstyle, but execution remains the deciding factor.

This structure ensures fairness while still allowing long term progression to matter across multiple sessions.

### Skill and Progression Relationship

Progression in Super Galactic complements gameplay rather than replacing it.

As players improve, they unlock additional depth through customization, upgrades, and strategic options. These systems reward continued engagement while preserving competitive integrity.

Mastery is earned through experience, learning, and refinement of skill.

### Play First Design

Super Galactic is designed so players can immediately enter matches and learn through play.

An optional tutorial is available for new players who want to learn the core mechanics before starting a match. The tutorial focuses on movement, combat, and basic gameplay and is not tied to ownership, purchases, or progression systems. 

There are no upfront purchases and no mandatory progression gates. Players are free to explore the game at their own pace and decide how deeply they want to engage with long term systems over time.
