This page explains how to start playing Super Galactic across available platforms and how to select the correct server region for the best gameplay experience.

### Play Super Galactic

Super Galactic can be accessed on multiple platforms.

**Browser**\
Play directly in your browser at:

https://sg.ufogaming.io

**Desktop**\
Download the desktop launcher for Windows:

**Android**\

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.UFOGaming.SupergalacticGame

Players can choose the platform that best fits their setup. All platforms provide access to the same core gameplay experience.

### Server Selection

Super Galactic operates across multiple server regions.

Available regions include:

- Europe
- US
- Asia

Players should select the server region closest to their physical location to reduce latency and ensure smooth gameplay.

### Playing With Friends

To play together, players must be connected to the **same server region**.

Before starting a match:

- Confirm all party members are on the same server
- Select the appropriate region during setup

Choosing different regions may result in higher latency or prevent matchmaking together.

### First Time Players

New players can begin playing immediately.

An optional tutorial is available to learn movement, combat, and core mechanics before entering live matches. Players can complete the tutorial or skip it and start playing right away.
