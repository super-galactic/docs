Progression in Super Galactic is designed to reward skill, consistency, and long term commitment rather than short term extraction. Players progress by improving their Genesis characters, upgrading weapons, and optimising loadouts through active gameplay.

### **Progression System**

Player progression is driven by three core elements:

- **Genesis progression**
  - Upgrading body parts using UAP
  - Increasing overall rating
  - Unlocking visual evolution and stronger stats
- **Weapon progression**
  - Weapon NFTs are obtained by opening Mystery Lootboxes
  - Upon reveal, weapons are assigned:
    - Melee or ranged type
    - Rarity
    - Damage type
    - **Randomised perks (for Uncommon, Rare, and Epic weapons)**
  - Weapons can then be upgraded using UAP to increase stats and rating
- **Rating based growth**
  - Higher Genesis and weapon ratings improve PvE performance
  - Rating directly influences UAP earning efficiency

Perks are **not purchased separately**. They are unlocked at the moment a lootbox is opened, making each weapon reveal a unique and strategic outcome.

### **Game Modes Overview**

| Mode | Description           | UAP Earning              | Notes                                |
| :--- | :-------------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| PvE  | Solo mission gameplay | Yes (5 missions per day) | Primary progression and earning mode |
| PvP  | Competitive battles   | Not yet                  | Skill and loadout focused            |
| TDM  | Team based combat     | Not yet                  | Wager based rewards plann            |

### **UAP Earning Rules**

UAP is earned exclusively through PvE mission completion.

To maintain balance and prevent inflation:

- Each Genesis can earn UAP from **up to 5 PvE missions per day**
- Gameplay remains **unlimited**, but earning is capped
- This design rewards consistent participation rather than excessive farming

Weapon rarity, upgrades, and overall rating affect combat performance, but the earning cap ensures a fair and sustainable economy.

### **Leaderboards and Competition**

Super Galactic features leaderboards ranked by **UAP earned through gameplay**. These leaderboards highlight top performing players and encourage competitive optimisation without introducing unlimited reward emissions.

Leaderboards reinforce progression as a skill based achievement rather than purely time based grinding.

### **Design Philosophy**

Progression and game modes are structured to:

- Encourage long term engagement
- Reward skill and optimisation
- Maintain economic sustainability
- Avoid pay to win mechanics

By separating playtime from earning limits and tying rewards to progression and rating, Super Galactic delivers a fair and balanced Play to Earn experience.
