Super Galactic offers multiple game modes that support both solo and competitive play. Each mode shares the same core mechanics while offering different objectives and social dynamics.

Players can switch between modes freely depending on whether they want to experience missions, test individual skill, or play competitively with friends.

### Single Player Mode

Single Player is a PvE focused mode built around mission based gameplay.

Players deploy into hostile environments to complete objectives and defeat AI controlled enemies. Mission difficulty can be selected, allowing players to choose between accessible encounters or more challenging scenarios.

This mode is designed for learning the game, practicing mechanics, and experiencing combat outside of competitive pressure. It is also the primary way new players become familiar with weapons, movement, and enemy behavior.

### Duel Mode

Duel is a PvP mode designed for one on one competition.

Players face a single opponent in direct combat, with victory determined by performance during the match. Duel mode emphasizes precision, movement, and decision making without team based variables.

This mode is ideal for players who want to test individual skill and mastery against other players in a controlled environment.

### Team Deathmatch

Team Deathmatch is a PvP mode focused on team based combat.

Two teams compete against each other with the goal of reaching the required number of eliminations. Matches reward coordination, positioning, and communication rather than isolated play.

Players can form teams by inviting friends or accepting friend requests before starting a match. Teams can be configured flexibly, supporting match sizes from two versus two up to five versus five.

Ownership of game assets is not required to join a team. Players without owned assets can participate alongside players who do own assets, ensuring access remains open and social play is unrestricted.

### Demo Access

All game modes are accessible through Demo access.

Demo access allows players to experience the full core gameplay without progression systems enabled. This mode is intended for learning, experimentation, and social play rather than long term advancement.

Players who choose to engage with progression systems can do so later without affecting access to gameplay modes.
