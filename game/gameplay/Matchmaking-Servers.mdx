Super Galactic uses region based servers and mode specific matchmaking rules to keep latency low and match behaviour predictable.

### Server Regions

Players select a server region before entering gameplay.

Supported regions:

- Europe
- United States
- Asia

Party members must be on the **same server region** to enter matches together. Region selection can be changed by the player before matchmaking.

### Matchmaking Rules

Matchmaking behaviour depends on the selected mode.

**PvE Missions**

- No matchmaking
- Missions launch immediately
- Difficulty selection and mission objectives define challenge and reward potential

**Duel (PvP)**

- Matches are created within the selected server region
- Matchmaking prioritises low latency and availability within that region

**Team Deathmatch (TDM)**

- Teams are formed manually through party invites
- Matches are created within the selected server region
- Supported team sizes: 2v2 up to 5v5 (max 10 players)

Asset ownership does not affect matchmaking eligibility.

### Party and Team Formation

Parties are created through invites and friend connections. The party leader controls match creation. All members must be on the same server region before the match can start.

### Fair Play Constraints

Match outcomes are not influenced by hidden matchmaking modifiers.

- No stat scaling to force close matches
- No reward modifiers tied to matchmaking
- Performance is determined by player execution, coordination, and progression state

### Communication

Super Galactic supports in game text chat for coordination.

- Direct messages between friends
- Coordination before and during multiplayer matches
