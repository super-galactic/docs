Super Galactic uses region based servers and structured matchmaking to ensure fair, responsive, and competitive matches. The system is designed to support both solo players and coordinated teams while maintaining consistent gameplay quality across regions.

---

### Server Regions

Super Galactic operates across multiple server regions to provide stable connections and low latency gameplay.

Available regions include:

- Europe
- US
- Asia

Players are automatically connected to the most appropriate server based on location and availability. Server selection is managed to prioritize match quality and performance.

### Matchmaking Overview

Matchmaking is designed to create balanced and competitive matches.

Players can enter matchmaking:

- Solo
- As part of a party
- As a full or partial team

The system considers party size and mode requirements to place players into appropriate matches while preserving fairness and playability.

---

### Party and Team Formation

Players can form parties by adding friends or sending friend requests.

Once grouped, a party leader can initiate matchmaking for supported modes. This allows players to coordinate teams before entering a match, similar to traditional competitive games.

For team based modes such as Team Deathmatch:

- Teams can range from two versus two up to five versus five
- Parties do not need to fill all available slots
- Matchmaking fills remaining slots when required

---

### Ownership and Matchmaking

Ownership of assets is not required to participate in matchmaking.

Players without owned assets can:

- Join parties with asset holders
- Be matched into teams normally
- Compete on equal mechanical footing

Matchmaking does not separate players based on ownership or progression status.

---

### Demo and Progression Interaction

Players using Demo access can participate in matchmaking across supported modes.

Demo matches allow full gameplay participation but do not contribute to progression, leaderboards, or earning systems. Matchmaking behavior remains consistent regardless of access type.

---

### Match Integrity

Matchmaking systems are designed to protect competitive integrity.

Core gameplay balance remains consistent across regions and modes. Match results are determined by player performance rather than access level, ownership, or external factors.
