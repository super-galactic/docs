Super Galactic uses region based servers and structured matchmaking to ensure stable performance, fair competition, and responsive gameplay across all modes.

Matchmaking is designed to prioritise low latency and consistent game experience rather than artificial balancing or hidden modifiers.

### Server Regions

Super Galactic operates across multiple server regions.

Players must select the **same server region** as their teammates in order to match together. Playing on the correct regional server helps minimise latency and ensures smoother combat, especially in real time multiplayer modes.

Server regions are selected before entering gameplay and remain consistent across sessions unless changed by the player.

Super Galactic currently supports the following server regions:

- Europe
- United States
- Asia

### Matchmaking Rules

Matchmaking behaviour varies by game mode.

- **Single Player (PvE):** Missions are launched instantly without matchmaking. Difficulty selection and mission objectives determine challenge and reward potential.
- **Duel (PvP):** Players are matched against other players within the same server region. Matchmaking prioritises responsiveness and availability.
- **Team Deathmatch (TDM):** Players form teams manually by adding friends or joining invited parties. Once a team is formed, the match is created within the selected server region.

Team Deathmatch supports team sizes from **2v2 up to 5v5**, with a maximum of **10 players per match**.

<Info>
  There is no requirement for all players in a team to own assets. Asset ownership does not affect matchmaking eligibility.

### Party and Team Formation

Players can create parties by inviting friends or accepting friend requests.

Party leaders control match creation and server selection. All party members must be connected to the same server region before starting a match.

This structure allows coordinated team play while preventing cross region latency issues.

### Communication

Super Galactic includes an in game text chat system that allows players to communicate directly with friends.

**Text chat supports:**

- Direct messaging between players on the friend list
- Coordination before and during multiplayer matches

Communication is designed to support social play and team coordination without introducing additional complexity during gameplay.

### Performance and Fair Play

Matchmaking does not use hidden modifiers to influence outcomes.

All players compete using the same underlying rules and systems. Performance is determined by player skill, coordination, progression state, and decision making rather than matchmaking manipulation.

### Design Intent

The matchmaking and server model is designed to:

- Preserve low latency gameplay
- Maintain consistent combat behaviour
- Support competitive integrity
- Allow players to form teams freely

By keeping matchmaking transparent and region aware, Super Galactic ensures a predictable and fair multiplayer experience.
