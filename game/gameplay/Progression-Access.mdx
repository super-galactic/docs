Super Galactic is designed to minimise barriers to entry while preserving meaningful long term progression.

Players can access the core game immediately, with progression and earning systems unlocking as they engage more deeply with gameplay and meet eligibility requirements.

### Access Model

Anyone can play Super Galactic without owning digital assets.

Players can experience combat, missions, and multiplayer modes without connecting a wallet or making purchases. Ownership is introduced as an optional extension of play rather than a requirement for access.

To unlock **Play to Earn PvE gameplay**, players must own **one Genesis Origin UFOep NFT**. A single Genesis character is sufficient to access earning eligible missions.

This approach allows players to onboard easily while avoiding the high entry costs seen in earlier Play to Earn models.

### Play to Earn Eligibility

Play to Earn in Super Galactic is tied exclusively to **PvE mission completion**.

UAP is earned only through successful gameplay, not through idle systems or passive activity. Rewards are calculated based on mission difficulty, objective completion, and performance.

Earning potential is influenced by:

- Genesis character rating
- Weapon rating
- Rarity and upgrade levels
- Combat performance

Failing to complete all mission objectives results in reduced rewards, reinforcing skill based progression.

### Starter Equipment

Players who enter **Play to Earn PvE gameplay** using a **Genesis Origin UFOep NFT** are provided with a **starter weapon pack** containing both a melee and a ranged weapon.

These starter weapons are:

- Non NFT
- Non upgradeable
- Designed for early progression and onboarding

The starter pack allows Genesis holders to enter earning eligible missions immediately, learn combat mechanics, and complete early missions without requiring additional purchases.

Players without a Genesis NFT can still access demo gameplay modes, but starter equipment for Play to Earn missions is only issued when entering PvE with a Genesis character.

### Optional Asset Progression

Weapon NFTs and advanced upgrades are **optional**, but provide deeper progression for committed players.

NFT weapons can be upgraded using UAP to increase ratings and enhance combat effectiveness. These systems reward long term engagement without being mandatory for entry.

This structure preserves fair access while supporting deeper progression paths for players who choose to invest more time or resources.

### Leaderboards and Competitive Progression

Super Galactic includes leaderboard systems designed to reflect meaningful performance across different gameplay modes.

Leaderboard rankings are mode specific and aligned with each mode’s purpose.

In demo and PvP modes, players are ranked based on multiplayer match wins, reinforcing competitive play and skill mastery without economic influence.

In Play to Earn PvE gameplay, players are ranked based on **UAP earned**, rather than the number of missions completed. This ensures rankings reflect performance efficiency, mission execution, and progression strength rather than repetition alone.

By separating leaderboard criteria by mode, Super Galactic maintains fair competition while reinforcing its progression and earning philosophy.

### In Game Account Overview

Super Galactic provides an in game account overview that allows players to track progression and activity in real time.

The account overview displays:

- Current UAP balance
- Total UAP earned
- Total UAP spent on upgrades and progression
- Activity history for missions and spending

This interface allows players to understand how their gameplay performance translates into progression and economic participation without leaving the game.

### Demo vs Play to Earn Tracking

Activity tracking behaves differently depending on the mode being played.

In **Demo Mode**, activity tracking is disabled. Missions can be played freely for practice and enjoyment, but progress, upgrades, and UAP rewards are not recorded.

In **Play to Earn PvE gameplay**, all eligible activity is recorded. Mission rewards, upgrade spending, and claim history are tracked and synchronized with the Super Galactic Hub, where rewards can be claimed and verified.

This separation ensures clarity between learning environments and progression enabled gameplay.

### Ownership and Team Play

Ownership is not required to access game modes or join teams.

Players without owned assets can:

- Join parties and team based modes
- Play alongside Genesis holders
- Compete on equal mechanical footing

Ownership enables progression and earning systems but never restricts access to gameplay or social play.

### Note

> Progression, rewards, and activity tracking described on this page apply only to Play to Earn PvE gameplay. Demo and competitive multiplayer modes are designed for learning, testing, and competition and do not record progression or generate UAP.

> Detailed mechanics for assets, upgrades, lootboxes, and economic systems are documented in the NFTs & Assets and Game Economy sections.
