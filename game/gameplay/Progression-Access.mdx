Super Galactic is designed with multiple access paths that allow players to experience the game first, then choose how deeply they want to engage with progression and earning systems.

All players share the same core gameplay experience. Progression and earning are layered on top as optional paths rather than entry requirements.

---

### Demo Access

Demo access allows anyone to play Super Galactic immediately.

Players using Demo access can enter available game modes and experience the full combat, movement, and multiplayer systems. This mode is designed for learning, experimentation, and social play.

Progression systems are disabled in Demo access. Matches played in Demo mode do not contribute to long term progression, leaderboards, or earning systems.

Demo access exists to let players understand the game on its own terms before committing to deeper systems.

---

### Progression Enabled Play

Progression enabled play unlocks long term advancement systems within Super Galactic.

Players who enable progression can:

- Develop characters over time
- Access upgrades and customization
- Track competitive performance across matches

Progression is earned through active gameplay and performance. There are no passive progression mechanics and no shortcuts that bypass skill or participation.

Progression enhances depth and long term engagement but does not change core gameplay balance within individual matches.

---

### Play to Earn Access

Play to Earn access is available to players who hold a **Genesis UFOeps character**.

This access path allows players to:

- Participate in earning systems
- Earn UAP tokens through gameplay
- Contribute to long term competitive and economic loops

Play to Earn access does not provide mechanical advantages in matches. Earning is tied to active participation and performance rather than ownership alone.

> Players without Play to Earn access can still play all game modes, join teams, and compete normally, but they do not earn UAP or progress through earning based systems.

---

### Leaderboards and Competitive Tracking

Super Galactic includes leaderboards that track player performance over time.

Leaderboards reflect competitive results, progression milestones, and gameplay activity. They are designed to reward consistency, skill, and long term engagement rather than isolated outcomes.

Participation in leaderboards requires progression enabled play. Demo access matches do not contribute to leaderboard rankings.

---

### Ownership and Team Play

Ownership is not required to access game modes or join teams.

Players without owned assets can:

- Join parties and team based modes
- Play alongside Genesis holders
- Compete on equal mechanical footing

Ownership enables progression and earning systems but never restricts access to gameplay or social play.

---

### Switching Between Access Types

Players are free to move between Demo access, progression enabled play, and Play to Earn access depending on their preferences.

Choosing not to engage with progression or earning systems does not limit access to gameplay modes. Players can explore Super Galactic at their own pace and decide when or if they want to participate in long term systems.
