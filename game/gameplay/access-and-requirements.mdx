### Play to Earn Requirements

Play to Earn gameplay is available through PvE missions only.

To participate in Play to Earn PvE gameplay, players must:

- Connect a compatible wallet
- Own at least one Genesis character NFT

Genesis characters can be minted or acquired through the Super Galactic Hub marketplace.

See NFTs & Assets → [Genesis Mint Pricing ](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/nfts-assets/minting-and-pricing#genesis-mint-pricing)for Genesis NFT details.

### Starter Weapon Pack

Players who enter Play to Earn PvE gameplay using a Genesis Origin UFOep NFT are provided with a starter weapon pack containing both a melee and a ranged weapon.

These starter weapons are:

- Non-NFT
- Non-upgradeable

The starter pack allows players to enter earning-eligible PvE missions, learn core combat mechanics, and complete early missions without requiring additional asset purchases.

Weapon NFTs and advanced equipment remain optional and are documented separately.

See NFTs & Assets → [Lootbox Pricing](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/nfts-assets/minting-and-pricing#lootbox-pricing) for weapon details.
