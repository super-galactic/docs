This page outlines the network, wallet, and asset requirements needed to access progression-enabled and Play to Earn gameplay in Super Galactic.

<Note>
  Super Galactic supports EVM-compatible wallets. MetaMask is recommended. Other supported options include Coinbase Wallet and WalletConnect-compatible wallets. 
</Note>

### Network and Wallet Access

Super Galactic operates on the BNB Chain.

A wallet is required only for progression-enabled and Play to Earn access. Demo access remains wallet-free. Mode eligibility and access differences are summarised in Gameplay → [Game Modes.](/game/gameplay/game-modes)

<Tip>
  To get started with MetaMask, install the MetaMask browser extension or mobile app, create a wallet, and securely store your recovery phrase. The wallet is used to connect to the Super Galactic Hub and approve progression-enabled actions. 
</Tip>

### Play to Earn Requirements

Play to Earn gameplay is available through PvE missions only.

To participate in Play to Earn PvE gameplay, players must:

- Connect a compatible wallet
- Own at least one Genesis character NFT

Genesis characters can be minted or acquired through the Super Galactic Hub marketplace.

See NFTs & Assets → [Genesis Mint Pricing ](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/nfts-assets/minting-and-pricing#genesis-mint-pricing)for Genesis NFT details.

### Starter Weapon Pack

Players who enter Play to Earn PvE gameplay using a Genesis Origin UFOep NFT are provided with a starter weapon pack containing both a melee and a ranged weapon.

These starter weapons are:

- Non-NFT
- Non-upgradeable

The starter pack allows players to enter earning-eligible PvE missions, learn core combat mechanics, and complete early missions without requiring additional asset purchases.

Weapon NFTs and advanced equipment remain optional and are documented separately.

See NFTs & Assets → [Lootbox Pricing](https://supergalactic.mintlify.app/game/nfts-assets/minting-and-pricing#lootbox-pricing) for weapon details.
