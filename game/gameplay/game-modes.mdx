Super Galactic offers multiple modes designed for different playstyles, from wallet-free onboarding to competitive multiplayer and progression-enabled play. The structure supports Web2-style accessibility first, with optional Web3 participation introduced only when players choose to engage with ownership and progression.

### Demo Mode (Wallet-Free Access)

Demo mode allows players to experience core combat and game feel without connecting a wallet or owning NFTs.

In demo mode, players can:

- Play using a curated selection of characters with different ratings and rarities
- Test a variety of loadouts and gameplay styles
- Experience bred character variants for broader build variety

Demo mode is designed for onboarding and experimentation. It does not include progression or earning.

<Tip>
  Non-NFT players can join live multiplayer matches alongside NFT holders, allowing friends to play together immediately without ownership requirements.

### Single Player (PvE Missions – Play to Earn)

PvE missions are objective-driven encounters where players use their owned NFTs and equipped weapons in structured gameplay designed for progression.

In PvE missions, players can:

- Enter missions with owned characters and gear
- Complete objectives through combat, positioning, and execution
- Generate reward outcomes based on mission completion and performance
- Progress into upgrades and build refinement over time

Mode eligibility and earning rules are summarised in Economy → [Reward System](/game/economy/rewards-system).

### Player vs Player (PvP)

PvP modes are designed for competitive play and skill expression. Matches focus on execution, timing, and decision making under direct pressure from other players.

In PvP, players can:

- Compete in direct player vs player matchups
- Practice and refine loadouts under competitive conditions
- Improve performance through repetition and mastery

PvP modes do not include earning and are intended to remain purely competitive.

### Team Deathmatch (TDM)

Team Deathmatch is a team-based mode built for fast matches, coordination, and squad play.

In TDM, players can:

- Form teams and compete against other squads
- Play in formats ranging from small teams up to 5v5
- Coordinate tactics and team composition in shorter match cycles

### Planned: Free-to-Play Progression (Roadmap)

Super Galactic is also exploring a free-to-play progression mode as part of the roadmap. This mode is intended to provide a progression path that does not require NFTs, tokens, or a wallet connection.

Instead of token earning, players would progress through a points-based system tied to activity, unlocking characters and additional content over time.

This section will be expanded once the design is finalised.
