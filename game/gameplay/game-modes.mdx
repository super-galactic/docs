Super Galactic supports multiple gameplay modes with clearly defined rules around progression, rewards, and asset usage. Modes are designed to support wallet free onboarding, competitive play, and progression enabled gameplay without overlapping responsibilities.

### Demo Mode (Wallet-Free Access)

Demo Mode provides access to core gameplay without requiring a wallet or NFT ownership.

Rules:

- No wallet connection required
- No progression tracking
- No UAP rewards
- Characters and builds are provided for testing and learning

Demo Mode is intended for onboarding, experimentation, and learning core combat systems.

<Tip>
  Non-NFT players can join live multiplayer matches alongside NFT holders, allowing friends to play together immediately without ownership requirements.

### PvE Missions (Play to Earn)

PvE Missions are the only gameplay mode that generates UAP rewards.

Rules:

- Requires a connected wallet
- Requires ownership or rental of a Genesis character
- Progression and upgrades are enabled
- Rewards are generated based on mission completion and difficulty

PvE missions are structured, objective driven encounters designed for repeatable progression and earning.

Reward caps, cooldowns, and claim flow are defined in Economy → [Rewards System](/game/economy/rewards-system).

### Player vs Player (PvP)

PvP modes are designed for competitive play and skill expression.

Rules:

- Wallet connection optional
- No UAP rewards
- No progression output
- All outcomes are performance based

PvP modes are progression neutral and reward neutral. They exist to support competitive mastery, testing builds, and team coordination.

### Team Deathmatch (TDM)

Team Deathmatch is a structured PvP mode focused on coordinated team play.

Rules:

- Team based matches (2v2 up to 5v5)
- Manual party formation
- No rewards or progression output

TDM prioritises fast match cycles, coordination, and replayability.

### Planned Mode: Free to Play Progression (Roadmap)

A free to play progression mode is planned as part of the roadmap.

Scope:

- No NFTs required
- No UAP rewards
- Progression via internal point systems

This mode is not live and may change prior to release. Details will be documented once the system is finalised.
