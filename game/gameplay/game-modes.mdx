Super Galactic offers multiple game modes designed to support different playstyles, progression goals, and competitive experiences. Each mode serves a distinct purpose within the overall game loop.

While all modes share the same core combat mechanics, only specific modes are eligible for earning rewards.

### Single Player (PvE · Play to Earn)

Single Player is the primary **Play to Earn** mode in Super Galactic.

Players complete structured missions across multiple planets, each offering increasing difficulty and reward potential. Missions are objective driven, requiring players to complete all assigned tasks in order to qualify for maximum rewards.

Key characteristics:

- Difficulty based missions, with higher levels offering higher potential rewards
- Objective based completion system
- Rewards calculated based on performance and objectives completed

For example, a high difficulty mission may offer a maximum reward of up to **500 UAP**, but only if all objectives are successfully completed. Partial completion results in reduced rewards, calculated by the system based on mission progress.

This structure ensures that earning is tied to skill, execution, and consistency rather than passive participation.

Single Player mode supports:

- Progression through repeatable missions
- Skill development and mastery
- Long term earning through active gameplay

### Duel (PvP)

Duel mode is a one on one competitive PvP experience.

Players face off using their characters, equipment, and builds to test skill, reaction time, and loadout effectiveness. Matches are fast paced and focused on individual performance.

This mode is commonly used to:

- Test character builds and upgrades
- Compete directly against other players
- Showcase owned characters and equipment

Duel mode does not generate Play to Earn rewards and is designed purely for competitive gameplay.

### Team Deathmatch (TDM)

Team Deathmatch is a team based PvP mode where two teams compete to reach a target number of eliminations.

Players can form teams by adding friends or sending friend requests. Teams support flexible sizes, including 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, and up to 5v5.

Key characteristics:

- Team coordination and strategy
- Competitive multiplayer combat
- Social play with friends and communities

<Info>
  Players do not need to own assets to join teams with asset holders, maintaining accessibility while enabling social competition.

TDM is a competitive and social mode and does not include earning mechanics.

### Demo and Progression Enabled Play

Super Galactic supports both demo access and progression enabled gameplay.

Demo access allows players to experience core gameplay, combat, and modes without engaging progression or earning systems. This mode is intended for learning, testing, and onboarding.

Progression enabled play unlocks long term systems such as upgrades, progression tracking, and Play to Earn eligibility. Access to earning is restricted to specific modes and conditions and is not available across all gameplay types.

### Mode Design Philosophy

Each game mode is designed with a clear purpose.

- PvE focuses on progression and earning
- PvP focuses on competition, mastery, and social play

This separation ensures economic balance while allowing players to engage with Super Galactic in different ways without compromising fairness or accessibility.
